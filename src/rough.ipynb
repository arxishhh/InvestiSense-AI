Requirements: Ticker must exist. All requested years must be covered. Both filings must be used: 10K and 10Q (use only if asked explicitly). The query asks about \"latest year of all quarters\". That suggests we need 10Q for the latest year (2025? current year Jan 2026, latest year completed would be 2025). Also need 10K for the latest year (2025). The query is about products and services, which is in 10K Item 1 (business) and possibly 10Q Item 2 (management discussion). The requirement says both filings must be used: 10K and 10Q (use only if asked explicitly). The query didn\\'t explicitly ask for 10Q, but \"latest year of all quarters\" implies need 10Q. So we need both.\\n\\nWe need to identify ticker for Apple: AAPL.\\n\\nYears needed: latest year: 2025 (assuming 2025 is the latest full year). For 10K: 2025. For 10Q: all quarters of 2025 (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4). The tool TenQFilingTool can fetch all quarters for given years; we can request sections relevant: for products and services we need Item 1? Actually 10Q doesn\\'t have Item 1; but we may need Item 2 (management discussion). So sections \"2\". Also maybe \"1\" for unaudited statements not needed. But we need evidence of products/services, likely in 10K Item 1. So we need TenKFilingTool sections \"1\". For 10Q we might also need \"2\". We\\'ll fetch both.\\n\\nCheck checklist:\\n\\nTicker identified? No yet. Need to find ticker for Apple. We can use tickerTOOL.\\n\\nThen collect 10K for 2025 section \"1\". Also 10Q for 2025 all quarters sections \"2\". Ensure years covered.\\n\\nProceed: first get ticker.\\n\\n', 'tool_calls': [{'id': 'fc_d1789e13-c578-475d-ae2a-e9bc30bc842a', 'function': {'arguments': '{\"state\":{\"company\":[\"Apple\"]}}', 'name': 'tickerTOOL'}, 'type': 'function'}]}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 482, 'prompt_tokens': 1318, 'total_tokens': 1800, 'completion_time': 1.043598152, 'prompt_time': 0.079601067, 'queue_time': 0.045655781, 'total_time': 1.123199219, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 446}}, 'model_name': 'openai/gpt-oss-120b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_a09bde29de', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'tool_calls', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c4cdd-85d9-7f00-9038-0694a5fa5f03-0', tool_calls=[{'name': 'tickerTOOL', 'args': {'state': {'company': ['Apple']}}, 'id': 'fc_d1789e13-c578-475d-ae2a-e9bc30bc842a', 'type': 'tool_call'}], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1318, 'output_tokens': 482, 'total_tokens': 1800})"

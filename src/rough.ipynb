Identify missing evidence.\\n\\nUser query: \"Describe Apple’s products and services from the latest year of all quarters.\"\\n\\nRequirements: Must collect filing evidence. Both filings must be used: 10K and 10Q (use only if asked explicitly). The query asks about \"latest year of all quarters\" => need 10Q for latest year (2025) covering all quarters. Also need 10K for description of products/services (Item 1). The collected proofs list: \"TICKER APPLE : AAPL Item 1 of 10K AAPL 2025 Item 2 of 10Q AAPL 2025\". So we have Item 1 of 10K 2025, and Item 2 of 10Q 2025. However, need to ensure coverage of all quarters of latest year. Item 2 of 10Q likely covers one quarter? The requirement says \"If 10Q is mentioned in the proofs it means that it contains all quarters.\" The note: \"PROOFS ARE THE HOLY GRAIL NO NEED TO VERIFY THEM.\" So we have both 10K and 10Q for 2025. Ticker identified? Yes. All years covered? The latest year is 2025, we have that. So all requirements satisfied.\\n\\nThus we should return DONE. Need to ensure checklist:\\n\\nTicker identified: YES\\n10K proofs collected: YES (optional)\\n10Q proofs collected: YES (optional)\\nAll years covered: YES\\n\\nAll good.

       "  'text': 'Item 1A.    Risk Factors\\nBusiness and Strategic Risks\\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth, increasing interest rates, inflationary pressures, instability and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n- reduced demand and longer sales cycle for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;\\n- increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n- increased price pressure for our products and services; and\\n- greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions has in the past and may in the future result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough, these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\\nEconomic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The overall effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates had no impact on revenue growth for the year ended October 31, 2025 when compared to the same period last year. Typically, when movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact on our profitability by reducing our costs and expenses, or vice versa. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts and other inputs to us and our products to our customers;\\n- ongoing instability or changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by pandemics like COVID-19, conflicts in Ukraine/Russia and the Middle East, and political and trade uncertainties in the greater China region;\\n- changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, as well as changes to tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;\\n- tariffs imposed by the United States on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including tariffs and trade policies by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods;\\n- negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export;\\n- difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing labor regulations; and\\n- differing protection of intellectual property.\\nWe sell many of our products internationally.  Furthermore, we source many components and materials for our products from and have manufacturing operations in several countries. Future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remain uncertain, and the potential commencement and escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nMost of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If economic, political, health or other conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nour receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nIn addition, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements within any given twelve-month period. Therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond any twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n- properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;\\n- innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;\\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;\\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n- price our products competitively;\\n- anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control product quality in our manufacturing process.\\nIn addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures.\\nDemand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.\\nOur customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions, medical reimbursement policies and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government or research funding may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nRecent and dynamic government rule making and policy changes could increase our costs, affect our markets and customers and impact our results of operations.\\nThe rapid increase in new government regulations, including tariffs and proposed tariffs in the geographies and markets in which we operate, could result in significant costs and require modifications in the way we and our customers conduct business. As we and our customers respond to newly enacted rules and legislation, effects on purchasing behavior and global trade relationships could affect our revenue. Increases in our costs and expenses related to our compliance or mitigation activities and those of our customers and suppliers could have a negative effect on our operating margin. If we are unable to respond to changing regulations in a timely and effective manner, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\\nIn addition, geopolitical instability and evolving trade regulations, including tariffs, sanctions, and export controls, may restrict our ability to ship products globally or source critical components. These developments can increase costs, disrupt supply chains, and require operational adjustments. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties, loss of export privileges, and reputational harm.\\nCurrently, United States federal agencies are operating under a continuing resolution that is set to expire on January 30, 2026. Without appropriation of additional funding to federal agencies, our business operations related to our product sales to customers receiving funding from the U.S. federal government could be impacted. Inadequate funding for government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other disruptions to these agencies\\' operations, such as actions to greatly reduce the size of the federal workforce, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner, or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of the businesses of certain of our customers and our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses, which could adversely affect our income.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. We believe our pay levels are competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.\\nOur strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.\\nWe have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nOur acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, fiscal year, or over the long term. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets, and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result, in unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.\\nIntegrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\nEven if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.\\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranties for products of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nPublic health crises may adversely impact, and pose risks to, certain elements of our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics. Public health crises, and any related remediation measures such as quarantine, curfew and other travel and activity restrictions, may impact our operations and sales and delivery of products and services. Our supply chain has in the past and may in the future be impacted, and we could experience disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. We\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nmay be unable to accurately predict the full extent and duration of the impact of a public health crisis on our business and operations due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the crisis, the efficacy and distribution of vaccines, containment measures and additional waves of infection.\\nRegulatory, Legal and Compliance Risks\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation, China\\'s Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, the California Consumer Privacy Act and Brazil\\'s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and when personal data may be transferred outside the country where it was collected. Many such laws impose significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the General Data Protection Regulation or orders to stop processing personal data in a particular jurisdiction). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\\nWe must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Such laws demand that we implement, test, and monitor an effective compliance program in order to detect and prevent instances of non-compliance. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, suspension of government contracts or debarment, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\\nThese regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines, suspension of government contracts or debarment and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products in conformance with these regulations to meet customer needs. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nbusiness would suffer.\\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service-related activities, from quality management, design and development to manufacturing, labeling, promotion, sales, distribution and post-market surveillance. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these and other regulatory authorities.  If we or any of our suppliers, distributors or customers fail to comply with Food and Drug Administration regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate, increased difficulty in obtaining required Food and Drug Administration clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; corresponding customer and third party claims; or the inability to sell our products. Any such Food and Drug Administration or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services. For example, in May 2022, the EU began enforcing the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the EU. These new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical evidence requirements, quality management systems and post-market surveillance activities. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\\nSome of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.\\nSome of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws, to prevent unreasonable risks to human health or the environment. Under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has authority to require reporting, record-keeping and testing, and to implement restrictions relating to chemical substances and/or mixtures. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing (domestic production or importation of) any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the Environmental Protection Agency for its effect on health and safety or which is not listed on the Environmental Protection Agency Toxic Substances Control Act chemical substance inventory. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, storing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, suspension of government contracts or debarment, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\\nOur internal controls and compliance systems may not always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.\\nThe expectations and requirements of regulators and other key stakeholders, including on corporate governance and sustainability-related matters, continue to evolve and diverge, and our ability to meet these expectations and requirements could impact our risk exposure and financial conditions.\\nWe are subject to rapidly changing and varied expectations and requirements, including on corporate governance and sustainability issues, from a wide range of stakeholders, such as governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, U.S. federal and state governments, New York Stock Exchange, and the European Union, as well as our investors, customers and suppliers. In addition, many of our stakeholders have diverging demands, perspectives and preferences, including on topics such as climate change and diversity. We may not be able to meet the diverse expectations and demands of all of our stakeholders, which could result in an adverse impact on our business, financial results, stock price or reputation, and subject us to legal, reputational and operational risks.\\nFor example, U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as governmental authorities in various jurisdictions, have proposed or implemented and are likely to continue to propose or implement, legislative and regulatory initiatives around corporate governance and environmental and social practices and disclosures. Compliance with such evolving expectations, rules and regulations, including any that may emerge in the future as well as those incorporated in our contractual obligations from our customers, could increase the cost and complexity of operating our business, and could adversely impact us. In addition, various jurisdictions have adopted or proposed laws, regulations and policies that diverge from, or potentially conflict with, those adopted or proposed in other jurisdictions, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. Failure to comply with any law, regulation or policy, including as a result of making good faith interpretations that may differ from those taken by authorities in relevant jurisdictions, could potentially result in legal, reputational and operational risks.\\nFurthermore, any actual or perceived failure to achieve our current and future sustainability goals, including those which result from contractual obligations from our customers, or to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional sustainability-related legal or regulatory requirements, could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully achieve any sustainability-related goal or execute on any sustainability-related strategy, or adequately meet stakeholder expectations with respect to such matters. Our ability to deliver on any sustainability-related goal or strategy is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include rapidly shifting regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations, our ability to recruit and retain a robust workforce, the activities and availability of suppliers and other business partners, cost considerations and the development and availability of cost-effective technologies or resources.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.\\nCertain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination.  Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Siemens Healthineers (formerly Varian Medical Systems, Inc.).  Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nfor which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities, may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\\nOur current and historical manufacturing and research and development processes and facilities are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes and facilities. We cannot predict how changes will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance to us, our customers or our suppliers. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanctions, including fines, penalties or suspensions, restrictions on our operations and reputational damage.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\\nIssues in the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence technologies in our business operations, services and products may result in reputational harm, regulatory action, or legal liability, and any failure to adapt to such technological developments or industry trends could adversely affect the competitiveness of our business.\\nWe are integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies (\"AI\") into our business operations, products and services, while continuing to explore the opportunities that AI could bring to the company. The use of AI, particularly generative AI, presents opportunities as well as risks that could negatively impact the business. The development, deployment, and use of AI, including within the life sciences industry, is still in its early stages, where the use of insufficiently developed AI technologies and premature deployment practices could result in unintended outcomes that harm the business. AI technologies may be developed using inaccurate, incomplete, flawed or biased algorithms, training methodologies or data, which could result in competitive harm, regulatory penalties, legal liability, or brand or reputational harm. Further, a failure to timely and effectively use or deploy AI and integrate it into new product offerings and services could negatively impact our competitiveness, particularly ahead of evolving industry trends and evolving consumer demands. We may be unable to devote adequate financial resources to develop or acquire new AI technologies and systems in the future.\\nUse of AI to improve internal business operations, or in the development or provision of products or services, poses risks and challenges. AI can pose risks from an intellectual property, confidential data leakage, data protection and privacy perspective, as well as raise ethical concerns, compliance issues, and security risks. The input of confidential information or trade secrets into AI systems may result in the loss of intellectual property, proprietary rights, or attorney-client privilege in such information or trade secrets. The use of AI technologies for developing products or services may adversely affect or preclude the company\\'s intellectual property rights in such products or services, or may expose the company to liability related to the infringement, misappropriation or other violation of third-party intellectual property. The use of AI technologies with personally identifiable information may also result in legal liability. Further, particularly given the nascent stage of the technology, the use of AI can lead to unintended consequences, including the generation of outputs that appear correct but are factually inaccurate, misleading, or that result in unintended biases and discriminatory outcomes, or are otherwise flawed, which could harm our reputation and business and expose us to risks related to such inaccuracies or errors in these outputs.\\nMoreover, AI is subject to a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment, which, without appropriate review, governance and risk management, could expose the company to unforeseen legal or regulatory scrutiny and liabilities. As such, it remains uncertain how AI laws and regulations will impact our business or the associated cost or risks related to compliance therewith or with respect to embedding compliance mechanisms appropriately and effectively into our operations. The use of AI may be subject to new legal or regulatory requirements, the impact of which may be prohibitive or pose further risks from a legal or regulatory action perspective.\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which could not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish, maintain and enforce our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results.\\nOur pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors could avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenue. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\nOperational Risks\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during a market downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our gross margins and operating results.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies, and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.\\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our facilities to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery or other logistics providers we use experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, which could result in increased costs, and/or delay the delivery of our products. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology and other administrative functions. Since information technology is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our information technology providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or information technology outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, public health crises, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other climate-change related risks, including resource scarcity, rationing or unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices that may be caused by extreme weather conditions. In addition, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. In addition, our facilities in California are susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as drought, flooding and wildfires. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, these coverages are subject to deductibles as well as caps and may not be sufficient to cover the entirety of potential losses in certain catastrophic events. We do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we would be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. For example, in December 2020, it was widely reported that SolarWinds, an information technology company, was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients. We identified an impacted SolarWinds server and promptly took steps to contain and remediate the incidents. While we believe that there were no disruptions to our operations as a result of this attack, other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems or products could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees,\\n28\\nTable of Contents\\npartners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage. Concern over increasingly prevalent cyberattacks or other forms of security breaches of information technology systems can result in additional legal and regulatory requirements in the markets we operate our business and may lead to increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations. For example, as a U.S. publicly traded company, we are subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Final Rule on Cybersecurity Risk Management, Strategy, Governance and Incident Disclosure which requires enhanced disclosure requirements for cybersecurity, with similar applicable requirements under the EU\\'s NIS2 Directive and China\\'s Data Security Law.\\nFinancial and Tax Risks\\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\\nChanges in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.\\nWe are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nWe benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Singapore has granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe are party to a $1.5 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on June 7, 2028, pursuant to which we are permitted to establish an incremental revolving credit facility of up to $750 million. We also entered into an Uncommitted Money Market Line Credit agreement which provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of $300 million. Under our U.S. commercial paper program, the company may issue and sell unsecured, short-term promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount not to exceed $1.5 billion with up to 397-day maturities. As of October 31, 2025, we had approximately $3.4 billion in outstanding indebtedness which included an aggregate outstanding principal amount of $3.3 billion in unsecured senior notes. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.\\n29\\nTable of Contents\\nOur incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n- increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n- requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and\\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry.\\nOur credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nWe cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\\nSince the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\\nAs of October 31, 2025, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,789 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions and volatility in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid or hinder our ability to borrow money in the amounts, at interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that could be available under different economic circumstances. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.',\n",

(\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.\\nIn November 2024, we announced a change in our organizational structure to support our market-focused, customer-centric strategy. Our former Diagnostics and Genomics segment combined with our liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry instrument platforms to form our new Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets segment. Our chemistries and supplies, laboratory automation, and software and informatics divisions moved from our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets segment to our Agilent CrossLab segment. The remaining divisions in our former Life Sciences and Applied Markets segment which includes our gas chromatography, gas chromatography mass spectrometry, remarketed instruments, spectroscopy and vacuum divisions formed our new Applied Markets segment.\\nFollowing this re-organization, we have three business segments - Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets, Agilent CrossLab and Applied Markets, each of which comprises a reportable segment. All historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation.\\nOur Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets segment is comprised of seven areas of activity. We provide specialty contract development and manufacturing services for pharmaceutical customers as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. The Agilent CrossLab segment spans the entire lab with its extensive services and consumables portfolio in addition to software and laboratory automation solutions, which are designed to improve customer outcomes and represents a broad range of offerings designed to serve customer needs across end-markets and applications. Our Applied Markets segment provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products.\\nIn addition, we conduct centralized order fulfillment and supply chain operations for our businesses through the order fulfillment and supply chain organization (\"OFS\"). OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. Each of our businesses, together with OFS, is supported by our global infrastructure organization, which provides shared services in the areas of finance, information technology, legal, certain procurement services, workplace services and human resources.\\n3\\nTable of Contents\\nWe sell our products primarily through direct sales, but we also utilize distributors, resellers, manufacturers\\' representatives and electronic commerce. As of October 31, 2025, we employed approximately 18,100 people worldwide. Our primary research and development and manufacturing sites are in California, Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Texas and Vermont in the U.S. and in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\\nLife Sciences and Diagnostics Markets\\nOur Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets segment is comprised of seven areas of activity.

Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in Australia, China, Italy, Malaysia, and Singapore.\\nApplied Markets - Competition\\nThe markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition. Our principal competitors in the applied markets arena include: Danaher Corporation, PerkinElmer Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Waters Corporation. We compete on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.\\nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our business segments through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, tax, treasury, legal, real estate, insurance services, workplace services, human resources, information technology services, quality and regulatory services, corporate development and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Generally, these organizations are managed from Santa Clara, California, with operations and services provided worldwide. As of October 31, 2025, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 1,900 people worldwide.\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organizations\\nOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (\"OFS\") focuses on order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering, logistics, and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, Regulatory Affairs and Human Capital Management include information common to each of our business segments.\\nResearch and Development\\nWe anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.\\nBacklog\\nWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter\\'s orders. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur Life Sciences and Diagnostics Markets, Agilent CrossLab and Applied Markets segments all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur research and development, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws. We also maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\nClimate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems, disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements. Although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning, such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense.\\nIn addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, we strive to advance our sustainability practices. In 2021, we announced our goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.  In 2023, we announced near and long term greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.\\nRegulatory Affairs\\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities, from quality management, design and development to manufacturing, labeling, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate; increased difficulty in obtaining required U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. In May 2022, the European Union began enforcing the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical evidence requirements, quality management systems and post-market surveillance activities.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.\\nWe are also subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, geopolitical instability and evolving trade regulations, including tariffs, sanctions, and export controls, may restrict our ability to ship products globally or source critical components. These developments can increase costs, disrupt supply chains, and require operational adjustments.  A failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties, loss of export privileges, and reputational harm. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.\\nIn addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), Brazil\\'s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados, China\\'s Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, with many such laws imposing significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\\nWhile we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nHuman Capital Management\\nAs of October 31, 2025, we employed approximately 18,100 persons, of whom approximately 7,100 were based in the Americas, 4,400 in Europe and 6,600 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.\\nMission.\\nOur instruments, software, services, solutions and people provide trusted answers to customers\\' most challenging questions. Whether we are working with our customers to keep food supplies safe, improve the quality of air, water and soil, or fight cancer with more precise diagnoses and targeted treatments, our employees share a passion and commitment to advancing the quality of life. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to fulfill that commitment.\\nEngagement.\\nWe engage with our employees through consultation, surveys, ad-hoc feedback and reviews. Our executive officers hold all-managers meetings on a quarterly basis to provide business updates and answer questions. We conduct leadership surveys that allow employees to provide feedback on leadership effectiveness, culture and job satisfaction. We have an open-door policy where employees are encouraged and empowered to bring issues to management\\'s attention. Employees have regular performance reviews with immediate supervisors. Employee sessions are held regularly to share business and market updates and answer employee questions.\\nPeople and Culture.\\nAs a global company, much of our success is rooted in our commitment to a work culture that values broad perspectives, respect for others, and strong engagement across the company. Agilent is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe in a workforce where employees with different perspectives and backgrounds are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents.\\nRetention\\n. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. Our benefits are offered to eligible employees and comply with local legal requirements. We have a number of programs and policies designed to help employees in our workforce manage their work and personal lives while meeting company objectives for business success, including flexible work arrangements, health and welfare benefits, employee and family assistance plans and parental leave.\\nDevelopment\\n. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development for current and rising managers. Training at Agilent takes several forms: face-to-face classroom experiences, on-the-job learning, virtual classroom events and self-paced e-learning. We are committed to providing an environment in which employees can expand their knowledge, develop new skills, and contribute their best work. Our culture of continuous development instills in our employees the behaviors that bring our values to life every day. We encourage our people to stay up-to-date on current research and technology while enhancing their current skills and growing new skills to meet future needs; we also put special emphasis on training managers at all levels to effectively communicate, role model and reinforce our values and culture.\\nHealth and Safety.\\nThe health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us.  Our environmental, health and safety management system provides a framework for assessing and managing risks relating to health and safety. We ensure managers and employees receive periodic workplace safety training and provide wellness programs that contribute to the productivity, health, and well-being of employees. In addition, our crisis management program includes a global tool that enables us to reach, locate and support employees in travel or in crisis areas. We regularly evaluate and review with senior management the performance of our programs and processes.\\nCommunity\\n. Each year our employees throughout the world devote thousands of volunteer hours to community service activities. Our employees may take up to six days of paid time off each year for volunteer activities with charities and organizations. We also support a giving program, which provides employees the opportunity to support a broad range of eligible non-profit organizations in their communities in the areas of health and human services, arts and culture, education and literacy, environment and conservation, and family and civic betterment.\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nInformation about our Executive Officers\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nBret DiMarco\\n, 57, has served as our Senior Vice President, Agilent and Chief Legal Officer and Secretary since July 2024.

       "  'text': 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors\\nBusiness and Strategic Risks\\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth, increasing interest rates, inflationary pressures, instability and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n- reduced demand and longer sales cycle for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;\\n- increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n- increased price pressure for our products and services; and\\n- greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Also, longer sales cycles for our products may impact our expectations of orders for future fiscal quarters. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough, these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n- properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;\\n- innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nprospects;\\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;\\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n- price our products competitively;\\n- anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control product quality in our manufacturing process.\\nIn addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures.\\nEconomic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2023, had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 2 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n- ongoing instability or changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by pandemics like the COVID-19, the current conflicts in Ukraine/Russia and the Middle East, and political and trade uncertainties in the greater China region;\\n- changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, as well as, new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;\\n- tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods;\\n- negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export;\\n- difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing labor regulations;\\n- differing protection of intellectual property;\\n- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\\n- geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, terrorism and war; and\\n- impact of public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19 on the global economy.\\nWe sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries. Future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain, which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nMost of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If economical, political, health or other conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nIn addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nDemand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.\\nOur customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions, medical reimbursement policies and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nOur strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.\\nWe have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets, and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.\\nIntegrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\nEven if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.\\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nPublic health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact, and pose risks to, certain elements of our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. For example, the recent global spread of COVID-19 had an adverse impact on our operations, sales and delivery and supply chains. Many countries including the United States implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew, travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations. Due to these measures we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products. Moreover, these measures caused delays in installations and significantly impacted our ability to service our customers on site. Public health crises may also impact our supply chain as we could experience disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. We may be unable to accurately predict the full extent and duration of the impact of a public health crisis on our business and operations due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the crisis, the efficacy and distribution of vaccines, containment measures and additional waves of infection. As conditions improve, there may be increases in demand for certain of our products, which could pose challenges to our supply chain. If there are supply shortages or delays and we are not able to meet increasing product demand, our results would be adversely affected.\\nRegulatory, Legal and Compliance Risks\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), Brazil\\'s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados, the California Consumer Privacy Act and China\\'s Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and when personal data may be transferred outside the country where it was collected. Many such laws impose significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR or orders to stop processing personal data in a particular jurisdiction). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nfines, penalties and other damages.\\nWe must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Such laws demand that we implement, test, and monitor an effective compliance program, in order to detect and prevent instances of non-compliance. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\\nThese regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.\\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these and other regulatory authorities.  If we or any of our suppliers, distributors or customers fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate, increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services. For example, the EU has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the \"EU IVDR\"), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance activities. The new EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\\nSome of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.\\nSome of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nControl Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the EPA for its effect on health and safety and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, storing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.\\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.\\nWe are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance.\\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC and NYSE, as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance and environmental and social practices and disclosures. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the U.S., local and foreign governments, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. The increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations, rules and regulations, as well as any risk of noncompliance, could adversely impact us.\\nIn addition, we face increasing scrutiny from stakeholders with respect to environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") practices and disclosures. Also, various legal and regulatory requirements specific to ESG matters in the U.S., local or other jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent. For instance, we are subject to various laws against forced labor which have been promulgated by many regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate. Any failure to adequately address stakeholder expectations with respect to ESG matters may result in noncompliance and adverse impact on our business, financial results, stock price or reputation. For example, our ability to achieve our current and future ESG goals is uncertain and remains subject to numerous risks, including evolving regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations, our ability to recruit and retain a diverse workforce, the availability of suppliers and other business partners that can meet our ESG expectations and standards, cost considerations and the development and availability of cost-effective technologies or resources that support our ESG goals.\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nEnvironmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.\\nCertain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination.  Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Siemens Healthineers (formerly Varian Medical Systems, Inc.).  Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities, may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\\nOur current and historical manufacturing and research and development processes and facilities are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes and facilities. We cannot predict how changes will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance to us, our customers or our suppliers. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions, restrictions on our operations and reputational damage.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results.\\nOur pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\nOperational Risks\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies, and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.\\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity which could occur due to our plans to expand certain manufacturing capacities, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results.\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase, and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, public health crises, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other climate-change related risks, including resource scarcity, rationing or unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices that may be caused by extreme weather conditions. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China led to mandated shutdown of our facilities in Shanghai, which adversely impacted our business and results, and impacted our supply chain. In\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\naddition, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. In addition, our facilities in California are susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as drought, flooding and wildfires. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. For example, in December 2020, it was widely reported that SolarWinds, an information technology company, was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients. We identified an impacted SolarWinds server and promptly took steps to contain and remediate the incidents. While we believe that there were no disruptions to our operations as a result of this attack, other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage. Concern over increasingly prevalent cyberattacks or other forms of security breaches of information technology systems can result in additional legal and regulatory requirements in the markets we operate our business and may lead to increased compliance burdens and costs to meet the regulatory obligations.\\nFinancial and Tax Risks\\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\\nChanges in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.\\nThe Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes and is contemplating additional changes to numerous long-standing\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\ntax principles. There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if and when finalized, once adopted by countries, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes.\\nWe are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nWe benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Singapore has granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe are party to a $1.5 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on June 7, 2028 and a $600 million term loan facility that matures on April 15, 2025.  Furthermore, we are permitted pursuant to the credit agreement to establish incremental facilities of up to $750 million. We also entered into an Uncommitted Money Market Line Credit agreement which provides for an aggregate borrowing capacity of $300 million. The credit facility is an uncommitted short-term cash advance facility where each request must be at least $1 million. As of October 31, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility, the incremental facilities and the uncommitted money market line credit facility. As of October 31, 2023, we had  no borrowings outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program. We also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion in senior unsecured notes and $600 million outstanding under the term loan facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.\\nOur incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n- increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n- requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and\\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry.\\nOur credit facility and our term loan facility each imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nWe cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\\nSince the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nother business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant.

Our products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost.\\nAgilent CrossLab Manufacturing\\nOur direct service delivery organization is regionally based and operating in 29 countries.\\nAgilent CrossLab Competition\\nOur principal competitors in the services arena include many of our competitors from the instrument business such as: Danaher Corporation, PerkinElmer Inc., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and Waters Corporation, as well as numerous niche service providers. We compete on the basis of reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories (\"Agilent Labs\") is our central research organization based in Santa Clara, California. Agilent Labs create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in our core businesses and expanding Agilent\\'s footprint into adjacent markets. At the cross-roads of the organization, the Agilent Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across our businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value.\\nThe technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including molecular and cell biology, chemistry, physics, pathology, mathematics, software and informatics, artificial intelligence, deep and machine learning, image processing, nano/microfabrication, and fluidics.\\nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, tax, treasury, legal, real estate, insurance services, workplace services, human resources, information technology services, order administration and other corporate infrastructure expenses. Generally, these organizations are managed from Santa Clara, California, with operations and services provided worldwide. As of October 31, 2023, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,700 people worldwide.\\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organizations\\nOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (\"OFS\") focuses on order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials,  Environmental, Regulatory Affairs and Human Capital Management include information common to each of our businesses.\\nResearch and Development\\nWe anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.\\nBacklog\\nWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter\\'s orders. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur research and development, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws. We also maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nClimate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems, disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements. Although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning, such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense.\\nIn addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, we are also committed to sustainability and environmental protection. In 2021, we committed to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050.  As part of our climate action plan, we have established near and long term emission reduction targets to limit planetary\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\nwarming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels which have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (\"SBTi\"). For more information on our approach to sustainability management, refer to our 2022 ESG report, which is available on our website.\\nRegulatory Affairs\\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. In Europe, the European Union has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (\"EU IVDR\"), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance activities. The new EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.\\nWe are also subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.\\nIn addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), Brazil\\'s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados, China\\'s Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, with many such laws imposing significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\\nWhile we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nAs of October 31, 2023, we employed approximately 18,100 persons, of whom approximately 6,900 were based in the Americas, 4,500 in Europe and 6,700 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.\\nMission.\\nOur instruments, software, services, solutions and people provide trusted answers to customers\\' most challenging questions. Whether we are working with our customers to keep food supplies safe, improve the quality of air, water and soil, or fight cancer with more precise diagnoses and targeted treatments, our employees share a passion and commitment to\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\nadvancing the quality of life. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to fulfill that commitment.\\nEngagement.\\nWe engage with our employees through consultation, surveys, ad-hoc feedback and reviews. Our executive officers hold all-managers meetings on a quarterly basis to provide business updates and answer questions. We conduct an annual leadership survey that allows employees to provide feedback on leadership effectiveness, culture and job satisfaction. We have an open-door policy where employees are encouraged and empowered to bring issues to management\\'s attention. Employees have regular performance reviews with immediate supervisors. Employee sessions are held regularly to share business and market updates and answer employee questions.\\nDiversity and Inclusion.\\nAs a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from providing managers transparency of their workforce pay equity to working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds. Agilent is committed to creating a diverse work environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. As of October 31, 2023, approximately 38 percent of our full-time employees were female. Approximately 42 percent of our board is comprised of directors representing underrepresented groups as of the date of this report. We have launched a number of company-wide initiatives including employee-network groups aimed at promoting engagement of traditionally underrepresented groups of employees.\\nRetention\\n. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. Our benefits are offered to eligible employees and comply with local legal requirements. We have a number of programs and policies designed to help employees in our diverse workforce manage their work and personal lives while meeting company objectives for business success, including flexible work arrangements, health and welfare benefits, employee and family assistance plans and parental leave.\\nDevelopment\\n. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development for current and rising managers. Training at Agilent takes several forms: face-to-face classroom experiences, on-the-job learning, virtual classroom events and self-paced e-learning. We are committed to providing an environment in which employees can expand their knowledge, develop new skills, and contribute their best work. Our culture of continuous development instills in our employees the behaviors that bring our values to life every day. We encourage our people to stay up-to-date on current research and technology while enhancing their current skills and growing new skills to meet future needs; we also put special emphasis on training managers at all levels to effectively communicate, role model and reinforce our values and culture.\\nHealth and Safety.\\nThe health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us.  Our environmental, health and safety (\"EHS\") management system provides a framework for assessing and managing risks relating to health and safety. We ensure managers and employees receive periodic workplace safety training and provide wellness programs that contribute to the productivity, health, and well-being of employees. In addition, our crisis management program includes a global tool that enables us to reach, locate and support employees in travel or in crisis areas. We regularly evaluate and review with senior management the performance of our programs and processes.\\nCommunity\\n. Each year our employees throughout the world devote thousands of volunteer hours to community service activities. Our employees may take up to six days of paid time off each year for volunteer activities with charities and organizations. We also support a giving program, which provides employees the opportunity to support a broad range of eligible non-profit organizations in their communities in the areas of health and human services, arts and culture, education and literacy, environment and conservation, and family and civic betterment.\\nInformation about our Executive Officers\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nHenrik Ancher-Jensen,\\n58, has served as our Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment and Supply chain since September 2013.

       "  'text': 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors\\nBusiness and Strategic Risks\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, certain elements of our business, results of operations and financial condition, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics such as COVID-19. The global spread of COVID-19 had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, sales and delivery and supply chains. Many countries including the United States implemented measures such as quarantine, shelter-in-place, curfew, travel and activity restrictions and similar isolation measures, including government orders and other restrictions on the conduct of business operations. Due to these measures we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products. Moreover, these measures caused delays in installations and significantly impacted our ability to service our customers on site. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China led to a mandated shutdown of our facilities in Shanghai, which negatively impacted our business and results, and impacted our supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic also impacted our supply chain as we experienced disruptions or delays in shipments of certain materials or components of our products. While many of our customers have returned to work and economic activity has ramped up, we are unable to accurately predict the full extent and duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the efficacy and distribution of vaccines, containment measures and additional waves of infection.  As COVID-19 conditions improved, there have been increases in demand for certain of our products, which posed challenges to our supply chain. If there are supply shortages or delays and we are not able to meet increasing product demand, our results would be adversely affected.\\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant volatility in U.S. and international markets. The impact of the pandemic may increase the possibility of uncertainty in the global financial markets, high inflation and extended economic downturn, which could reduce our ability to incur debt or access capital and impact our results and financial condition even after local conditions improve. There are no assurances that the credit markets or the capital markets will be available to us in the future or that the lenders participating in our credit facilities will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligations.\\nAs COVID-19 conditions have improved, the duration and sustainability of any such improvements will be uncertain and continuing adverse impacts and/or the degree of improvement may vary dramatically by geography and by business. The actions we take in response to any improvements in conditions may also vary widely by geography and by business and will likely be made with incomplete information; pose the risk that such actions may prove to be premature, incorrect or insufficient; and could have a material, adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth, inflationary pressures, instability and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n- reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;\\n- increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n- increased price pressure for our products and services; and\\n- greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough, these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n- properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;\\n- innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;\\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;\\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n- price our products competitively;\\n- anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control product quality in our manufacturing process.\\nIn addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures.\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sales of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.\\nDemand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.\\nOur customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.\\nEconomic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2022, had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of approximately 4 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n- ongoing instability or changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts, including uncertainties and instability in economic and market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine/Russia conflict and political and trade uncertainties in the greater China region;\\n- changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, as well as, new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties, trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nbarriers;\\n- tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods;\\n- negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export;\\n- difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing labor regulations;\\n- differing protection of intellectual property;\\n- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\\n- geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, terrorism and war; and\\n- impact of public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, such as COVID-19 on the global economy.\\nWe sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries. Future tariffs and tariffs already implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain, which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nMost of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivable and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If economical, political, health or other conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nIn addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business, operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third-party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nOur strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.\\nWe have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future. These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets, and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances,\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nconsolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.\\nIntegrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\nEven if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.\\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nRegulatory, Legal and Compliance Risks\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nprivacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), Brazil\\'s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados, the California Consumer Privacy Act and China\\'s Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and when personal data may be transferred outside the country where it was collected. Many such laws impose significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR or orders to stop processing personal data in a particular jurisdiction). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\\nWe must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Such laws demand that we implement, test, and monitor an effective compliance program. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\\nThese regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.\\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products and services may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. In addition, we are subject to inspections by these and other regulatory authorities.  If we or any of our suppliers, distributors or customers fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate, increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent for our products and services. For example, the EU has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the \"EU IVDR\"), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new regulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical requirements, quality systems and post-market\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nsurveillance activities. The new EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\\nSome of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.\\nSome of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the EPA for its effect on health and safety and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, storing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.\\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.\\nCertain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination.  Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Siemens Healthineers (formerly Varian Medical Systems, Inc.).  Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed or provided indemnities, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\ncontamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that expose us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs.\\nOur current and historical manufacturing and research and development processes and facilities are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes and facilities. We cannot predict how changes will affect our business operations or the cost of compliance to us, our customers or our suppliers. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions, restrictions on our operations and reputational damage.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third-party intellectual property licenses, and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property, and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer, which could harm our operating results.\\nOur pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure expectations and regulations that impact compliance costs and risks of noncompliance.\\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC and NYSE, as well as evolving investor expectations around corporate governance and environmental and social practices and disclosures. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by the U.S. and foreign governments, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. The increase in costs to comply with such evolving expectations, rules and regulations, as well as any risk of noncompliance, could adversely impact us.\\nOperational Risks\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies, and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.\\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity which could occur due to our plans to expand certain manufacturing capacities, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results.\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase, and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies and impact our results of operations and our stock price.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, public health crises, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other climate-change related risks, including resource scarcity, rationing or unexpected costs from increases in fuel and raw material prices that may be caused by extreme weather\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nconditions. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the outbreak of COVID-19 in China led to mandated shutdown of our facilities in Shanghai, which adversely impacted our business and results, and impacted our supply chain. In addition, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. In addition, our facilities in California are susceptible to extreme weather conditions such as drought and wildfires. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. For example, in December 2020, it was widely reported that SolarWinds, an information technology company, was the subject of a cyberattack that created security vulnerabilities for thousands of its clients. We identified an impacted SolarWinds server and promptly took steps to contain and remediate the incidents. While we believe that there were no disruptions to our operations as a result of this attack, other similar attacks could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations. Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\\nFinancial and Tax Risks\\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\\nChanges in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.\\nWe are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nregulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nWe benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Singapore has granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe are party to a $1.35 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024 and a $600 million term loan facility that matures on April 15, 2025.  Furthermore, we are permitted pursuant to the credit agreement to establish incremental facilities of up to $500 million. As of October 31, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility or the incremental facilities. On June 18, 2021, we increased the maximum amount of our commercial paper program to $1.35 billion.  As of October 31, 2022, we had borrowings of $35 million outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program and had a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.54 percent. We also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion in senior unsecured notes and $600 million outstanding under the term loan facility. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.\\nOur incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n- increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n- requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and\\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry.\\nOur credit facility and our term loan facility each imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nWe cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\\nSince the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\\nAs of October 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,053 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions and volatility in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid or hinder our ability to borrow money in the amounts, at interest rates or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available under different economic circumstances. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.',\n",

Our research and development efforts focus on potential new products and product improvements covering a wide variety of technologies, none of which is individually significant to our operations. Our research seeks to improve on various technical competencies in software, systems and solutions, life sciences and diagnostics. In each of these research fields, we conduct research that is focused on specific product development for release in the short-term as well as other research that is intended to be the foundation for future products over a longer time-horizon. Most of our product development research is designed to improve products already in production, focus on major new product releases, and develop new product segments for the future. We remain committed to invest significantly in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\nBacklog\\nWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter\\'s orders. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. To address any potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur research and development, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. We believe we are substantially in compliance with such environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws. We also maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nClimate change may impact our business by increasing operating costs due to impairments of our facilities and distribution systems, disruptions to our manufacturing processes and additional regulatory requirements. Although we address these potential risks in our business continuity planning, such events could make it difficult for us to deliver products and services to our customers and cause us to incur substantial expense.\\nIn addition to monitoring and managing compliance with environmental regulations, we are also committed to sustainability and environmental protection. In 2021, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050. For more information on our approach to sustainability management, refer to our 2021 ESG report, which is available on our website.\\nRegulatory Affairs\\nA number of our products and services are subject to regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product and service related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil or criminal penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; suspension or revocation of our license to operate; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. In Europe, the European Union has started to enforce new requirements, known as the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (\"EU IVDR\"), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of in vitro diagnostics in the European Union. These new\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\nregulations are more stringent in a variety of areas, including clinical requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance activities. The new EU IVDR requirements became effective starting in May 2022.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, criminal, civil and administrative penalties or debarment.\\nWe are also subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results.\\nIn addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business. Global privacy laws, including the EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), Brazil\\'s Lei Geral de Protecao de Dados, China\\'s Personal Information Protection Law and Data Security Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, apply to our activities involving the processing of personal data, both in relation to our product and service offerings and the management of our workforce. The global proliferation of privacy laws, with governmental authorities around the world passing or considering passing legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection, continues to result in new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, with many such laws imposing significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to four percent of total company revenue under the GDPR). Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\\nWhile we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws and regulations, any noncompliance could result in substantial fines or otherwise restrict our ability to operate and thereby have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To date, none has had a material impact on our operations.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nAs of October 31, 2022, we employed approximately 18,100 persons, of whom approximately 7,000 were based in the Americas, 4,400 in Europe and 6,700 in Asia Pacific. We also leverage temporary workers to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs.\\nCulture.\\nAgilent instruments, software, services, solutions and people provide trusted answers to customers\\' most challenging questions. Whether we are working with our customers to keep food supplies safe, improve the quality of air, water and soil, or fight cancer with more precise diagnoses and targeted treatments, Agilent employees share a passion and commitment to advancing the quality of life. We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees in order to fulfil that commitment.\\nEngagement.\\nAgilent engages with our employees through consultation, surveys, ad-hoc feedback and reviews. Our executive officers hold all-managers meetings on a quarterly basis to provide business updates and answer questions. We conduct an annual leadership survey that allows employees to provide feedback on leadership effectiveness, culture and job satisfaction. We have an open-door policy where employees are encouraged and empowered to bring issues to management\\'s attention. Employees have regular performance reviews with immediate supervisors. Employee sessions are held regularly to share business and market updates and answer employee questions.\\nDiversity and Inclusion.\\nAs a global company, much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce, from providing managers transparency of their workforce pay equity to working with managers to develop strategies for building diverse teams to promoting the advancement of leaders from different backgrounds. Agilent is committed to creating a diverse work environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. As of October 31, 2022, approximately 38 percent of our full-time employees were female. Approximately 42\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\npercent of our board is comprised of directors representing underrepresented groups as of the date of this report. We have launched a number of company-wide initiatives including employee-network groups aimed at promoting engagement of traditionally underrepresented groups of employees.\\nRetention\\n. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. Our benefits are offered to eligible employees and comply with local legal requirements. We have a number of programs and policies designed to help employees in our diverse workforce manage their work and personal lives while meeting company objectives for business success, including flexible work arrangements, health and welfare benefits, employee and family assistance plans and parental leave.\\nDevelopment\\n. As part of our promotion and retention efforts, we also invest in ongoing leadership development for current and rising managers. Training at Agilent takes several forms: face-to-face classroom experiences, on-the-job learning, virtual classroom events and self-paced e-learning. We are committed to providing an environment in which employees can expand their knowledge, develop new skills, and contribute their best work. Our culture of continuous development instills in our employees the behaviors that bring our values to life every day. We encourage our people to stay up-to-date on current research and technology while enhancing their current skills and growing new skills to meet future needs; we also put special emphasis on training managers at all levels to effectively communicate, role model and reinforce our values and culture.\\nHealth and Safety.\\nThe health and safety of our employees is a top priority for us.  Our environmental, health and safety management system provides a framework for assessing and managing risks relating to health and safety.  We regularly evaluate and review with senior management the performance of our programs and processes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took proactive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. In the U.S., we enacted safety measures, including social distancing protocols, encouraging employees to work from home when possible, suspending non-essential work travel, implementing various access controls at our facilities, frequently disinfecting our workspaces and providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees who are physically present at our facilities. As COVID-19 conditions improved, we implemented a phased reopening process and continued to prioritize health and safety.  We expect to continue to implement appropriate safety measures as necessary, and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.\\nCommunity\\n. Each year Agilent employees throughout the world devote thousands of volunteer hours to community service activities. Our employees may take up to six days of paid time off each year for volunteer activities with charities and organizations. We also support a giving program, which provides employees the opportunity to support a broad range of eligible non-profit organizations in their communities in the areas of health and human services, arts and culture, education and literacy, environment and conservation, and family and civic betterment.\\nInformation about our Executive Officers\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nHenrik Ancher-Jensen,\\n57, has served as our Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment since September 2013.

       "  'text': 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenue and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect as customer spending policies and budget allocations, particularly for capital items, may change. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services may become obsolete, and our operating results may suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services may become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results could suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n-  properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;\\n-  innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n-  appropriately allocate our research and development spending to products and services with higher growth prospects;\\n-  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n-  manufacture and deliver new products in sufficient volumes and on time;\\n-  differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n-  price our products competitively;\\n-  anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n-  control product quality in our manufacturing process.\\nIn addition, if we fail to accurately predict future customer needs and preferences or fail to produce viable technologies, we may invest in research and development of products and services that do not lead to significant revenue, which would adversely affect our profitability. Even if we successfully innovate and develop new and enhanced products and services, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our operating results may suffer. In addition, promising new products may fail to reach the market or realize only limited commercial success because of real or perceived concerns of our customers. Furthermore, as we collaborate with pharmaceutical customers to develop drugs such as companion diagnostics assays or provide drug components like active pharmaceutical ingredients, we face risks that those drug programs may be cancelled upon clinical trial failures.\\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the United States. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n-  reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;\\n-  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n-  increased price pressure for our products and services; and\\n-  greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past, we have experienced a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional expenses.\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nDemand for some of our products and services depends on the capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.\\nOur customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions.   Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidations, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and spending priorities, and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenue from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast, including changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.\\nEconomic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenue and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have decreased revenues by approximately 2 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2019. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions, outsourcing activities and manufacturing facilities are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n-  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n-  changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n-  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, such as the United Kingdom\\'s exit from the European Union, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, new or different customs duties trade embargoes and sanctions and other trade barriers;\\n-  tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from other countries and tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods, including the tariffs enacted and proposed by the U.S. government on various imports from China and by the Chinese government on certain U.S. goods;\\n-  negative consequences from changes in or differing interpretations of laws and regulations, including those related to tax and import/export;\\n-  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n-  differing labor regulations;\\n-  differing protection of intellectual property;\\n-  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n-  geopolitical uncertainty or turmoil, including terrorism and war.\\nWe sell our products into many countries and we also source many components and materials for our products from and manufacture our products in various countries.  Tariffs recently announced and implemented could have negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to any such change. Further, additional tariffs, the scope and duration of which, if implemented, remains uncertain, which have been proposed or threatened and the potential escalation of a trade war and retaliatory measures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\nMost of our accounting and tax processes including general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions are centralized at locations in India and Malaysia. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nIn addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve-month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business,\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\noperating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. For expenses beyond that twelve-month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nOur strategic initiatives to adjust our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.\\nWe have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future.  These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases.  In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions.  Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to hire and retain our key employees.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures, exiting of businesses and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic investments and alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. In addition, we may decide to exit a particular business within our product portfolio. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Acquired businesses may also expose us to new risks and new markets and we may have difficulty addressing these risks in a cost effective and timely manner. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result in, unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets, or, in the case of strategic investments and alliances, consolidate results, including losses, of third parties or write down investment values or loans and convertible notes related to the strategic investment.\\nIntegrating the operations of acquired businesses within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks.  Acquisitions and strategic investments and alliances may require us to integrate and collaborate with a different company culture, management team, business model, business infrastructure and sales and distribution methodology and assimilate and retain geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and key customers, increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements and increased costs and use of resources. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\nEven if we are able to successfully integrate acquired businesses within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the acquisition and integration of acquired businesses may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of such transactions.\\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nwe wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. In exiting a business, we may still retain liabilities associated with the support and warranty of those businesses and other indemnification obligations. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 and continue to enhance our controls. However, we cannot be certain that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations. Compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to regulations in the areas of health and safety, packaging, product content, employment, labor and immigration, import/export controls, trade restrictions and anti-competition. In addition, as a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in numerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal, sensitive and/or patient health data in the course of our business.  The EU\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to EU customers and workers. The GDPR established new requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4 percent of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world have passed or are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. Each of these privacy, security and data protection laws and regulations could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process end user personal data and could harm our results of operations and expose us to significant fines, penalties and other damages.\\nWe must also comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, anti-competition regulations and sanctions imposed by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control and other similar laws and regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\\nThese regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy any violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in the cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our operating results and business would suffer.\\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the FDA. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nA number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may in the future be subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product-related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA or other regulatory agency actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the global regulatory environment has become increasingly stringent. For example, the EU has adopted the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (the \"EU IVDR\"), which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems and post-market surveillance. Manufacturers will have until May 2022 to meet the EU IVDR requirements for in vitro diagnostic medical devices currently on the market. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to the EU requirements.\\nSome of our products are subject to particularly complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.\\nSome of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and the import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the United States that has not been reviewed by the EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be subject to civil penalties, criminal prosecution and, in some cases, prohibition from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenue from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, increased pricing pressure or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.\\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be harmed by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, employment practices and workplace behavior, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\ncompanies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.\\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plan assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.\\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have consolidated, and may further consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity may exceed our production requirements. If during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our gross margins, and operating results. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we may not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results.\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain, including logistics and third-party package delivery services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to manage costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. If one or more of the third-party package delivery providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, we may have to seek alternative providers, our costs could increase, and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenue and unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price.\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nEnvironmental contamination from past and ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities.\\nCertain properties we have previously owned or leased are undergoing remediation for subsurface contamination.  Although we are indemnified for liability relating to the required remediation at some of those properties, we may be subject to liability if these indemnification obligations are not fulfilled.  In other cases, we have agreed to indemnify the current owners of certain properties for liabilities related to contamination, including companies with which we have previously been affiliated such as HP, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) and Varian Medical Systems, Inc.  Further, other properties we have previously owned or leased at which we have operated in the past, or for which we have otherwise contractually assumed, or provided indemnities for, certain actual or contingent environmental liabilities may or do require remediation. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential environmental contamination at any of those properties or facilities, we may be exposed to material liability if environmental contamination at material levels is found to exist. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of certain companies, we have assumed other costs and potential or contingent liabilities for environmental matters.  Any significant costs or liabilities could have an adverse effect on results of operations.\\nOur current and historical manufacturing processes and operations involve, or have involved, the use of certain substances regulated under various foreign, federal, state and local environment protection and health and safety laws and regulations. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination and these liabilities may be substantial. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection and health and safety at our sites inside and outside the United States, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.  Further, in the event that any future climate change legislation would require that stricter standards be imposed by domestic or international environmental regulatory authorities, we may be required to make certain changes and adaptations to our manufacturing processes. Failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanction, including fines, penalties or suspensions.  If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against the development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses, we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will continue to be available to us in the future or can be expanded to cover new products on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.\\nOur pending patent, copyright and trademark registration applications may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be aware of or able to detect or prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\ncould make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which may allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\nChanges in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax examinations, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S., Singapore and various foreign jurisdictions. Governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate implement changes to tax laws and regulations periodically. Any implementation of tax laws that fundamentally change the taxation of corporations in the U.S. or Singapore could materially impact our effective tax rate and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial results.\\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act (\"the Tax Act\") significantly changed the taxation of U.S. based multinational corporations.  Our compliance with the Tax Act requires the use of estimates in our financial statements and exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions.  The implementation of the Tax Act requires interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), as well as state tax authorities.  The legislation could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, any of which could materially lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.  As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Act, and as we gather information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our financial position.\\nWe are also subject to examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions around the world. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. These assessments can require a high degree of judgment and estimation. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our financial results and condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nWe benefit from tax incentives extended to our foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted us tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Our taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If we cannot or do not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe are party to a $1 billion five-year unsecured credit facility that will expire on March 13, 2024.  As of October 31, 2019, the company had $115 million outstanding under the credit facility. On August 7, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement, which provides for a $500 million short-term loan facility that was used in full to complete the acquisition of BioTek. On October 21, 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement, which refreshed the amount available for additional incremental term loan facilities under the credit agreement to permit additional incremental facilities of up to $500 million. We had no borrowings under the additional incremental facilities as of October 31, 2019. We also currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.8 billion in senior unsecured notes. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock\\nOur incurrence of this debt and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n-  increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n-  requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends; and\\n-  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nOur credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or noteholders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events, or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, because we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities and we may not have redundant manufacturing capability readily available, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third-party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third-party insurance. If our third-party insurance coverage is adversely affected or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our financial condition will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\\nAs of October 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1,382 million invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our operating results and financial condition.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nRegulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\\nWe are subject to the rules of the SEC which require disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. Our ongoing implementation of these rules could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\\nWe cannot assure that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\\nSince the first quarter of fiscal year 2012, we have paid a quarterly dividend on our common stock. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.',\n",

(\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.\\nFor fiscal year ended October 31, 2019, we have three business segments comprised of the life sciences and applied markets business, diagnostics and genomics business and the Agilent CrossLab business.\\nOur life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of six areas of activity providing active pharmaceutical ingredients (\"APIs\") for oligo-based therapeutics as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes. In addition, we conduct centralized order fulfillment and supply chain operations for our businesses through the order fulfillment and supply chain organization (\"OFS\"). OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. Each of our businesses, together with OFS and Agilent Technologies Research Laboratories, is supported by our global infrastructure organization, which provides shared services in the areas of finance, information technology, legal, certain procurement services, workplace services and human resources.\\nWe sell our products primarily through direct sales, but we also utilize distributors, resellers, manufacturer\\'s representatives and electronic commerce. As of October 31, 2019, we employed approximately 16,300 people worldwide. Our primary research and development and manufacturing sites are in California, Colorado, Delaware, Massachusetts, Texas and Vermont in the U.S. and in Australia, China, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\\n3\\nTable of Contents\\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets Business\\nOur life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (\"LC\") systems and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (\"LCMS\") systems; gas chromatography (\"GC\") systems and components; gas chromatography mass spectrometry (\"GCMS\") systems; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (\"ICP-MS\") instruments; atomic absorption (\"AA\") instruments; microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (\"MP-AES\") instruments; inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (\"ICP-OES\") instruments; raman spectroscopy; cell analysis plate based assays; flow cytometer; real-time cell analyzer; cell imaging systems; microplate reader; laboratory software for sample tracking; information management and analytics; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; vacuum pumps and measurement technologies.\\nWe employed approximately 5,400 people as of October 31, 2019 in our life sciences and applied markets business.\\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets\\nOur life sciences and applied markets business focuses primarily on the following five markets:\\nThe Pharmaceutical, Biopharmaceutical, CRO & CMO Market.\\nThis market consists of \"for-profit\" companies who participate across the pharmaceutical value chain in the areas of therapeutic research, discovery & development, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control. One sub-segment of this market is core and emerging pharmaceutical companies (\"pharma\"). A second sub-segment includes biopharmaceutical companies (\"biopharma\"), contract research organizations (\"CROs\") and contract manufacturing organizations (\"CMOs\"). Biopharma companies and, to a somewhat lesser extent, CROs and CMOs typically participate in specific points in the pharmaceutical industry value chain.

       "  'text': 'ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. A large amount of our orders are  back-end loaded toward the end of our second and fourth fiscal quarters and their timing may be influenced by the sales incentive programs we have in place. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services.   Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n-  properly identify customer needs and predict future needs;\\n-  innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n-  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n-  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;\\n-  differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n-  price our products competitively;\\n-  anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n-  control product quality in our manufacturing process.\\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n-  reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;\\n-  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n-  increased price pressure for our products and services; and\\n-  greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nDemand for some of our products and services depends on capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.\\nOur customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services.  Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidation, spending priorities, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast.  These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nEconomic, political, foreign currency and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. International revenues and costs are subject to the risk that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. The unfavorable effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates has decreased revenues by approximately 6 percentage points in the year ended October 31, 2015. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n-  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n-  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n-  changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n-  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n-  negative consequences from changes in tax laws including changes to U.S. tax legislation that could materially increase our effective tax rate;\\n-  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n-  differing labor regulations;\\n-  differing protection of intellectual property;\\n-  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n-  geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.\\nWe centralized most of our accounting and tax processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable, accounts receivables and tax functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nAdditionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\\nIn addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nOur strategic initiatives could have long-term adverse effects on our business and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions.\\nWe have implemented multiple strategic initiatives across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar activities in the future.  These strategic initiatives and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities may distract management, could slow improvements in our products and services and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases.  In addition, delays in implementing our strategic initiatives, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions.  Any of the above circumstances could have an adverse effect on our business and financial statements.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term.  We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines. Transactions such as acquisitions have resulted, and may in the future result, in unexpected significant costs and expenses. In the future, we may be required to record charges to earnings during the period if we determine there is an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets, up to the full amount of the value of the assets. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including introducing new products and meeting revenue targets as expected, the retention of key employees and the retention of key customers.\\nThe integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and internal controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep and reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.  In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence in our financial statements and have an adverse effect on our stock price.\\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial statements and to effectively prevent fraud.  We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.  As further described in  Part II Item 9A \"Controls and Procedures.\" management has concluded that, because of a material weakness in accounting for income taxes, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of October 31, 2015.   The Company has and will continue to enhance its controls and expects to remediate the material weakness.   However, we cannot be certain that these measures will be successful or that we will be able to prevent future significant deficiencies or material weaknesses.  Inadequate internal controls could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on investor confidence in our financial statements, the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nIntegrating Dako A/S may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of Dako. In addition, the operation of Dako within Agilent may be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\\n-  our response to significant competitive pressure;\\n-  difficulties in meeting new product timelines;\\n-  the ability to grow in emerging markets;\\n-  increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements;\\n-  increased costs to address certain governmental regulations and compliance issues, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") warning letter received in August 2013 which has now been lifted by the FDA;\\n-  increased costs and use of resources; and\\n-  difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel.\\nEven if we are able to successfully operate Dako within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipated from the acquisition in the time frame that we expected, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we expected. As a result, the Dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve our operating margin targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our business would suffer.\\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nA number of our products are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nSome of our products are exposed to particular complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.\\nSome of our products and related consumables are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting.  If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.\\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.\\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nresults. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins, and operating results.\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain including logistics services, may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers, logistics providers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nCertain properties transferred to Keysight as part of the separation are undergoing remediation by HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) (together \"HP\") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP.  HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Keysight with respect to claims arising out of that contamination.  HP will have access to those Keysight properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require Keysight to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that Keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs.  We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations, in which case Keysight may seek indemnification from us. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.\\nOther than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP, we have agreed to indemnify HP, with respect to any liability associated with contamination from past operations, and Keysight, with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation, at, respectively, properties transferred from HP to us and properties transferred by us to Keysight.  While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.\\nOur current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Advantest Corporation and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\\nAs part of our acquisition of Varian, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\n1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nRegulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The rule, which went into effect for calendar year 2013 and requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st of each year, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. The rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, tantalum, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.\\nOur pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nintellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nAgilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted Agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Agilent\\'s taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If Agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States while most of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nAlthough the cash generated in the United States from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations, our stock repurchase program, our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1.6 billion in senior unsecured notes, and a $38 million secured mortgage. We also are party to a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in September 2019.  On June 9, 2015, we increased the commitments under the existing credit facility by $300 million so that the aggregate commitments under the facility now total $700 million and retained a provision that allows us to further increase commitments to the credit facility by $300 million in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.\\nOur incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n-  increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n-  requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions stock repurchases and dividends; and\\n-  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nOur current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   Our information technology systems also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with system integration, software upgrades or system migration work that takes place from time to time.  If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\\nAs of October 31 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.0 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.\\nWe could incur significant liability if the distribution of Keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.\\nWe have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of Keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\\' respective businesses and other matters.  If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.   Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\ntaxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\\nWe may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation with Keysight.\\nWe entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with Keysight to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward.  These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us.   The indemnity rights we have against Keysight under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us.  In addition, our indemnity obligations to Keysight may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Item 1.    Business\\nOverview\\nAgilent Technologies Inc. (\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that includes instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.\\nOn November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight Technologies, Inc. (\"Keysight\") to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014. The historical results of operations and the financial position of Keysight are included in the consolidated financial statements of Agilent and are reported as discontinued operations within this Form 10-K.\\nIn November 2014, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to better serve our customers. Our life sciences business, excluding the nucleic acid solutions division, together with the chemical analysis business combined to form a new segment called life sciences and applied markets business.  Our diagnostics and genomics businesses combined with the nucleic acid solutions division from our life sciences business and became the diagnostics and genomics segment. Finally, the Agilent CrossLab segment was formed from the services and consumables businesses previously part of the life sciences and chemical analysis businesses.  Financial reporting under this new structure is included within this report on Form 10-K and historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation within our financial statements.\\nOur life sciences and applied markets business provides application-focused solutions that include instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level. Our diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of three areas of activity providing solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. The Agilent CrossLab business spans the entire lab with its extensive consumables and services portfolio, which is designed to improve customer outcomes.

This business generated revenue of $2.0 billion in fiscal 2015, $2.1 billion in fiscal 2014 and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2013.\\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets\\nOur life sciences and applied markets business focuses primarily on the following five markets:\\nThe Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, CRO & CMO Market.\\nThis market consists of \"for-profit\" companies who participate across the pharmaceutical value chain in the areas of therapeutic research, discovery & development, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control. One sub-segment of this market is core and emerging pharmaceutical companies (\"pharma\"). A second sub-segment includes biotechnology companies (\"biotech\"), contract research organizations (\"CROs\") and contract manufacturing organizations (\"CMOs\"). Biotech companies and, to a somewhat lesser extent, CROs and CMOs typically participate in specific points in the pharmaceutical industry value chain. Additionally, due to the relatively low drug efficacy within oncology, pharma companies are partnering with diagnostic companies to bring validated tests to the market with their new drugs.\\nThe Life Science Research Market.\\nThis market consists primarily of \"not-for-profit\" organizations and includes academic institutions, large government institutes and privately funded organizations. The life science research market plays an influential role in technology adoption and therapeutic developments for pharmaceutical and molecular diagnostics companies. After decades of investment in basic biomedical research by government funding bodies, the focus has widened to include translational research - multidisciplinary scientific efforts directed at accelerating therapy development.\\nThe Chemical & Energy Market.\\nThe natural gas and petroleum refining markets use our products to measure and control the quality of their finished products and to verify the environmental safety of their operations. Petroleum refiners use our measurement solutions to analyze crude oil composition, perform raw material analysis, verify and improve refining processes and ensure the overall quality of gasoline, fuels, lubricants and other products. Our solutions are also used in the development, manufacturing and quality control of fine chemicals.\\nThe Environmental & Forensics Market.\\nOur instruments, software and workflow solutions are used by the environmental market for applications such as laboratory and field analysis of chemical pollutants in air, water, soil and solid waste. Environmental industry customers include all levels of government, the industrial and manufacturing sectors, engineering and consulting companies, commercial testing laboratories and colleges and universities.

This instrumentation is used in either static or mobile laboratories. Customers include local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies and health laboratories.\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nThe Food Market.\\nOur instruments, software, and workflow solutions are used throughout the food production chain, including incoming inspection, new product development, quality control and assurance, and packaging. For example, our mass spectrometer portfolio is used to analyze contaminants and residual pesticides in food. There is also a significant food safety market involved in analyzing food for pathogen contamination, accurate verification of species type and evidence of genetically modified content.\\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets Products and Applications\\nOur products fall into nine main areas of work: liquid chromatography, gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, software and informatics, lab automation and robotics, automated electrophoresis and microfluidics, vacuum technology and nuclear magnetic resonance systems.\\nOur key product and applications include the following technologies:\\nLiquid Chromatography\\nA liquid chromatograph or a high performance liquid chromatograph (\"HPLC\") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. The Agilent LC portfolio is modular in construction and can be configured as analytical and preparative systems. These systems can be stepwise upgraded to highly sophisticated, automated workflow solutions such as method development, multi‑method/walk-up, high-capacity/high-throughput or multi‑dimensional LC and can be extended to application‑based analyzers e.g. for bio-molecular separations, chiral analysis or size exclusion chromatography. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns, new services and diagnostics offerings and ongoing instrument and software product enhancements.\\nGas Chromatography\\nAgilent is the world\\'s leading provider of gas chromatographs, both laboratory and portable models. A gas chromatograph (\"GC\") is used to separate any gas, liquid or solid that can be vaporized and then detect the molecules present to determine their identity and quantity. Agilent provides custom or standard analyzers configured for specific chemical analysis applications, such as detailed speciation of a complex hydrocarbon stream, calculation of gas calorific values in the field, or analysis of a new bio-fuel formulation. We also offer related software, accessories and consumable products for these and other similar instruments.\\nMass Spectrometry\\nA mass spectrometer (\"MS\") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical\\'s molecular mass and characteristic patterns of fragment ion masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Liquid chromatography is commonly used to separate compounds and introduce them to the MS system. The combined use of LC and MS is frequently used both to identify and quantify chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing small molecules and can also be used to characterize and quantify proteins and other biological entities. Agilent\\'s LCMS portfolio includes instruments built around four main analyzer types - single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, time-of-flight (\"TOF\") and quadrupole time-of-flight (\"QTOF\"). We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry portfolio in recent years with a focus on improving performance, sensitivity, and ease of use.\\nSpectroscopy\\nSpectroscopy is a technique for analyzing the individual chemical components of substances based on the absorption or emission of electromagnetic radiation of specific wavelengths of light. Our spectroscopy instruments include atomic absorption (\"AA\") spectrometers, microwave plasma-atomic emission spectrometers (\"MP-AES\"), inductively coupled plasma-optical emissions spectrometers (\"ICP-OES\"), inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometers (\"ICP-MS\"), fluorescence spectrophotometers, ultraviolet- visible (\"UV-Vis\") spectrophotometers, Fourier Transform infrared (\"FT-IR\") spectrophotometers, near-infrared (\"NIR\") spectrophotometers, Raman spectrometers and sample automation products. We also offer related software, accessories and consumable products for these and other similar instruments.\\nSoftware and Informatics\\nWe provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics. Our software facilitates the compliant use of instruments in pharmaceutical quality assurance/\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nquality control environments. With OpenLab Laboratory Software Suite, Agilent has a scalable, open software platform that enables customers to capture, analyze, and share scientific data throughout the lab and across the enterprise.\\nLab Automation and Robotics\\nWe offer a comprehensive suite of workflow solutions to our life science customers with the addition of automated liquid handling and robotics that range from standalone instrumentation to bench-top automation solutions to large, multi‑armed robotic systems. These solutions strengthen our offering of automated sample preparation solutions across a broad range of applications.\\nAutomated Electrophoresis and Microfluidics\\nAutomated electrophoresis is a separation technique for bio molecules such as proteins, peptides and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) and is used to determine the identity of a molecule by either size or charge. It is widely used as a QC tool to check sample integrity prior to subsequent analysis.  Prominent examples are nucleic acid preparation products in front of polymerase chain reaction, NGS and microarrays.\\nVacuum Technology\\nOur vacuum technologies products are used to create, control, measure and test vacuum environments in life science, industrial and scientific applications where ultra-clean, high-vacuum environments are needed. Vacuum technologies\\' customers are typically OEMs that manufacture equipment for these applications. Products include a wide range of high and ultra-high vacuum pumps (diffusion, turbomolecular and ion getter), intermediate vacuum pumps (rotary vane, sorption and dry scroll), vacuum instrumentation (vacuum control instruments, sensor gauges and meters) and vacuum components (valves, flanges and other mechanical hardware). These products also include helium mass spectrometry and helium-sensing leak detection instruments used to identify and measure leaks in hermetic or vacuum environments. In addition to product sales, we also offer a wide range of services including an exchange and rebuild program, assistance with the design and integration of vacuum systems, applications support and training in basic and advanced vacuum technologies.\\nNuclear Magnetic Resonance\\nNuclear magnetic resonance products (\"NMR\") are used in a variety of industries including academic and not-for-profit research, life sciences (pharma and biotech), and industrial companies. All of these technologies are utilized for basic and applied research, and NMR is also used in process development and manufacturing QA/QC. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we announced the termination of our involvement in Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems (\"MRI\"). In the fourth quarter of 2014, we announced the termination of our NMR product line and our decision to cease the manufacture and sale of these items.\\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets Customers\\nWe had approximately 23,000 customers for our life sciences and applied markets business in fiscal 2015. No single customer represented a material amount of the net revenue of the life sciences and applied markets business. A significant number of our life sciences and applied markets customers are also customers of our Agilent CrossLab business.\\nThe life sciences and applied markets business is susceptible to seasonality in its orders and revenues primarily based on U.S. and foreign government budgets and large pharmaceutical company budgets. Historically, the result is that our first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to deliver the strongest profits for this group. However, general economic trends, new product introductions and competition might overshadow this trend in any given year.\\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets Sales, Marketing and Support\\nThe life science and applied markets channels focus on the therapeutics and human disease research customer base (pharma, biotech, CRO, CMO and generics), clinical customer base (high complexity clinical testing labs) and on emerging life sciences opportunities in life science research institutes. We deploy a multi-channel approach, marketing products to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers\\' representatives and distributors. We primarily use direct sales to market our solutions to our pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and clinical accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. We sell our consumable products through distributors, electronic commerce and direct sales.\\nOur products typically come with standard warranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost.\\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets Manufacturing\\nOur manufacturing supports our diverse product range and customer‑centric focus. We assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make standard products to stock. We employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times. Our manufacturing process then converts these designs into custom products for shipment to customers. We selectively use third parties to provide some supply chain processes for manufacturing, warehousing and logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California and Delaware in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in Germany, Malaysia, Singapore and the U.K.  We have a FDA registered site in California, Germany and Singapore. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing.\\nLife Sciences and Applied Markets Competition\\nThe markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition.

Agilent competes on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.\\nDiagnostics and Genomics Business\\nOur diagnostics and genomics business includes the reagent partnership, pathology, companion diagnostics, genomics and the nucleic acid contract manufacturing businesses.\\nOur diagnostics and genomics business is comprised of three areas of activity providing solutions that include reagents, instruments, software and consumables, which enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level. First, our pathology solutions business is focused on product offerings to cancer diagnostics and anatomic pathology workflows. The broad portfolio of offerings includes immunohistochemistry (\"IHC\"), In Situ Hybridization (\"ISH\"), Hematoxylin and Eosin (\"H&E\") staining and special staining. We also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also known as companion diagnostics, which may be used to identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Second, our genomics business includes arrays for DNA mutation detection, genotyping, gene copy number determination, identification of gene rearrangements, DNA methylation profiling, gene expression profiling, as well as Next Generation Sequencing (\"NGS\") target enrichment. Finally, our nucleic acid solutions business provides equipment and expertise focused on production of synthesized oligonucleotides under pharmaceutical Good Manufacturing Practices (\"GMP\") conditions for use as Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (\"API\") in an emerging class of drugs that utilize nucleic acid molecules for disease therapy.\\nWe employed approximately 2,000 people as of October 31, 2015 in our diagnostics and genomics  business. This business generated revenue of $0.7 billion in fiscal 2015, $0.7 billion in fiscal 2014, and $0.6 billion in fiscal 2013.\\nDiagnostics and Genomics Market\\nWithin diagnostics and genomics business, we focus primarily on the following market:\\nThe Diagnostics and Clinical Market\\n.   A significant part of our clinical diagnostic customers are in pathology labs throughout the world.  Our high-quality, automated pathology tissue staining platforms and solutions are used most heavily by the large labs located in hospitals, medical centers, and reference labs.  The market is skewed towards mature economies, with most of the market in North America, Western Europe and Japan.  The mix is changing, however, as emerging markets increase spending on human health.\\nThe clinical market for genomics consists of high complexity clinical labs performing patient testing, including \"for-profit\" reference laboratories, hospital labs, and molecular diagnostic companies. While these labs primarily purchase in vitro diagnostics (\"IVD\") labeled testing kits, they often develop and validate their own molecular based tests. Analyte Specific Reagents (\"ASRs\") are often used by these labs.\\n7\\nTable of Contents\\nDiagnostics and Genomics Products\\nOur products fall into six main areas of work: pathology products, specific proteins and flow reagents, target enrichment, cytogenetic research solutions and microarrays, PCR and qPCR instrumentation and molecular biology reagents and nucleic acid solutions.\\nPathology\\nThis area consists of routine clinical solutions for tissue based cancer diagnostics with solutions that comprise antibodies, reagents, instruments and software targeting both primary and advanced cancer diagnostics. Our CoverStainer and Artisan based product families target primary cancer diagnostics through Hematoxylin and Eosin staining as well as Special Stains for additional insights and detection of potentially carcinogenic tissue. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched our new combined IHC/ISH platform, Dako Omnis. The Dako Omnis and Autostainer based IHC solution and Instant Quality Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (\"IQFISH\") technologies provide advanced tumor typing through investigation of protein and gene expression. These products also include companion diagnostic tests that are used to help identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy.\\nSpecific Proteins and Flow Reagents\\nOur reagent OEM business is a provider of clinical diagnostic products within the areas of specific proteins for turbidimetry and reagents for flow cytometry. These are sold OEM as customized reagent solutions supplied to top IVD companies or through retail partners.\\nTarget Enrichment\\nAgilent continues to be a strong player in the next generation sequencing market. We provide a target enrichment portfolio composed of two main platforms, SureSelect and HaloPlex, both enabling customers to select specific target regions of the genome for sequencing. Customers can customize our products for their regions of interest using the SureDesign software, or they can choose from a wide range of catalog products, including gene panels for specific applications and Exome designs, which allow analysis of the entire coding sequences of the genome. After preparing samples with SureSelect and HaloPlex, products can be sequenced in the main next generation sequencing platforms available in the market. The technologies provide an easy sample prep workflow that can be automated with the Agilent Bravo platform for scalability.

Agilent competes on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.\\n11\\nTable of Contents\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories (\"Research Labs\") is our research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with offices in Europe and Asia. The Research Labs create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in Agilent\\'s core businesses and expanding Agilent\\'s footprint into adjacent markets. At the cross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent\\'s businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value.\\nThe technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including biology, chemistry,  distributed measurement, image processing, mathematics, nano/microfabrication, microfluidics, software, informatics, physics and physiology.\\nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. Generally these organizations are centrally operated from Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2015, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 1,800 people worldwide.\\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organizations\\nOur order fulfillment and supply chain organization (\"OFS\") centralizes all order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our businesses. OFS provides resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenditures were $330 million in 2015, $358 million in 2014 and $337 million in 2013, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services.\\nBacklog\\nWe believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for our business segments since a significant portion of our revenue for a given quarter is derived from the current quarter\\'s orders.  Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our business.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\n12\\nTable of Contents\\nMaterials\\nOur life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.\\nCertain properties transferred to Keysight as part of the separation are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (formerly Hewlett-Packard Company) (together \"HP\").   In addition, a subset of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located.  As part of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. In connection with the separation of Keysight, HP has agreed to transfer that indemnity to Keysight.  The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation of Keysight, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so, in which case Keysight may seek indemnification from us. It is also possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named under a remediation order.  The naming of Agilent will not affect HP\\'s obligation to indemnify us or Keysight with regard to these matters.  Under our agreement with HP and now HP\\'s agreement with Keysight, HP will have access to those Keysight properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that operations will not be interrupted or that Keysight will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. We cannot be sure that Keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs.  Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP have been sold.\\nWe are liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nAccording to the separation agreement with Keysight, we are liable and are indemnifying Keysight with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation at properties transferred by us to Keysight.  While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, other than the remediation by HP, there is no guarantee that such contamination does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe are being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.\\nAs part of our acquisition of Varian Inc., (\"Varian\") in 2010, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\nSemiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nWe maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 70 percent in fiscal 2015, 75 percent in fiscal 2014, and 72 percent in fiscal 2013, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were approximately 16 percent in fiscal 2015, 13 percent in fiscal 2014 and 16 percent in fiscal 2013. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.\\nLong-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 49 percent in fiscal year 2015 and 54 percent in fiscal year 2014.\\nMost of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 22, \"Segment Information\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition and Disposal of Material Assets\\nOn September 19, 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies, one comprising of the life sciences, diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that retained the Agilent name, and the other one that comprised of the electronic measurement business that was renamed Keysight Technologies, Inc. (\"Keysight\"). Keysight was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent on December 6, 2013. On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014.\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nHenrik Ancher-Jensen, 50\\n, has served as Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment since September 2013.

       "  'text': 'ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services.   Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner to address increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by increased competition through frequent new product and service introductions, rapid technological changes and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n-  properly identify customer needs;\\n-  innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n-  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n-  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;\\n-  differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n-  price our products competitively;\\n-  anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n-  control product quality in our manufacturing process.\\nUncertain general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Slower global economic growth and uncertainty in the markets in which we operate may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\n-  reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;\\n-  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n-  increased price pressure for our products and services; and\\n-  greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal trends in the demand for their products. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nDemand for some of our products and services depends on capital spending policies of our customers, research and development budgets and on government funding policies.\\nOur customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services.  Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidation, spending priorities, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Research and development budgets fluctuate due to changes in available resources, consolidation, spending priorities, general economic conditions and institutional and governmental budgetary policies. The timing and amount of revenues from customers that rely on government funding or research may vary significantly due to factors that can be difficult to forecast.  These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n-  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n-  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n-  changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n-  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n-  negative consequences from changes in tax laws including changes to U.S. tax legislation that could materially increase our effective tax rate;\\n-  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n-  differing labor regulations;\\n-  differing protection of intellectual property;\\n-  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n-  geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nWe centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nAdditionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\\nIn addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is an intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees, especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example in the past we completed various acquisitions, including Dako A/S. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:\\n-  the retention of key employees;\\n-  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n-  the retention of key customers;\\n-  the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company; and\\n-  the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company.\\nIn addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\ninvestors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n-  effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n-  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n-  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.\\nIn addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nIntegrating Dako A/S may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of Dako. In addition, the operation of Dako within Agilent could be a difficult, costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\\n-  difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel;\\n-  increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements; and\\n-  the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on additional investment or research and development activities in excess of our current expectations, which could offset any synergies resulting from the Dako acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding debt.\\nEven if we are able to successfully operate Dako within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect.  As a result, the Dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected revenue synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our business would suffer.\\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\\nA number of our products from our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics businesses are subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, warning letters, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. Any such FDA actions could disrupt our business and operations, lead to significant remedial costs and have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\\nIn August 2013, Dako Denmark A/S received a warning letter from the FDA relating to its quality management processes at our Glostrup facility.  Although we are committed to addressing the issues raised by the FDA, there can be no assurance that the FDA will be satisfied with the steps we have taken to address the issues or that the FDA will not raise additional areas of concern.  We may be subject to additional regulatory action by the FDA, including import bans, seizures, injunction and/or civil penalties and any such actions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial position and results of operations.\\nSome of our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics products are exposed to particular complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.\\nSome of our chemical analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics businesses are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must ensure conformance of the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting.  If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.\\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe life sciences industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\ncompetitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.\\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins, and operating results.\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nCertain properties transferred to Keysight as part of the separation are undergoing remediation by the Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP.  HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify Keysight with respect to claims arising out of that contamination.  HP will have access to those Keysight properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require Keysight to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that Keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs.  We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations, in which case Keysight may seek indemnification from us. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.\\nOther than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP, we have agreed to indemnify HP, with respect to any liability associated with contamination from past operations, and Keysight, with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation, at , respectively, properties transferred from HP to us and properties transferred by us to Keysight.  While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nthose properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.\\nOur current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\\nAs part of our acquisition of Varian, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nNew regulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\\nIn August 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The new rule, which went into effect for calendar year 2013 and requires an annual disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31st, requires companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country.  While we filed our initial report for calendar year 2013, there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence in regards to the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  In addition, our ongoing implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nunder acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.\\nOur pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nAgilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted Agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Agilent\\'s taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If Agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States while most of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nAlthough the cash generated in the United States from our operations should cover our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations, our stock repurchase program, our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.7 billion in senior unsecured notes, including $1.1 billion in Keysight senior unsecured notes, and a $42 million secured mortgage. We also are a party to a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in September 2019 and under which we may borrow up to $400 million and a Danish Krone denominated credit facility equivalent to $9 million. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.  Keysight is a party to a five-year revolving credit facility which expires in October 2019 for $300 million, initially guaranteed by us.  The guarantee was terminated upon the completion of the separation of Keysight on November 1, 2014.\\nOur incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n-  increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n-  requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases; and\\n-  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\\nOur current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\\nAs of October 31 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.0 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.\\nWe could incur significant liability if the distribution of Keysight common stock to our shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.\\nWe have received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution of Keysight qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Keysight and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\\' respective businesses and other matters.  If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, our shareholders and we may not be able to rely on the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities.   Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel we have received, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\\nWe may be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation.\\nWe entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements with Keysight to govern the separation and the relationship of the two companies going forward.  These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations and could lead to disputes between us.   The indemnity rights we have against Keysight under the agreements may not be sufficient to protect us.  In addition, our indemnity obligations to Keysight may be significant and these risks could negatively affect our financial condition.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Item 1.    Business\\nOverview\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. (\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is the world\\'s premier measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences, diagnostics and genomics, chemical analysis, communications and electronics industries.\\nOn September 19, 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies, one comprising of the life sciences, diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that will retain the Agilent name, and the other one that will be comprised of the electronic measurement business that will be renamed Keysight Technologies, Inc. (\"Keysight\"). Keysight was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent on December 6, 2013.  On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014. The historical results of operations and the financial position of Keysight are included in the consolidated financial statements of Agilent and will be reported as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of 2015.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, Agilent announced that it is exiting its NMR business. Agilent stopped taking new NMR system orders, but the company will continue to meet customer commitments for orders in progress and for ongoing support contracts and continue to provide service on all installed NMR systems. The company expects that this decision will eliminate about 300 jobs, mostly within the next 12 months. For the year ended October 31, 2014 charges of approximately $68 million were incurred with respect to the exit of this business.\\nOn June 21, 2012, we acquired Dako through the purchase of 100% of the share capital of Dako, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Denmark, under the share purchase agreement, dated May 16, 2012. Dako provides antibodies, reagents, scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories. As a result of the acquisition, Dako has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The consideration paid was approximately $2,143 million, of which $1,400 million was paid directly to the seller and $743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of Dako.  Agilent funded the acquisition using existing cash.\\nOur life sciences and diagnostics business focuses on the pharmaceutical, academic and government, bio-agriculture, food safety, clinical markets, biotechnology and contract research organization industries.

The market is skewed towards the mature economies, with most of the market in North America, Western Europe and Japan.  The mix is changing, however, as emerging markets increase spending on human health.\\nThe clinical market for genomics consists of high complexity clinical labs performing patient testing, including \"for-profit\" reference laboratories, hospital labs, and molecular diagnostic companies. While these labs primarily purchase in vitro diagnostics (\"IVD\") labeled testing kits, they often develop and validate their own molecular based tests. Analyte Specific Reagents (\"ASRs\") are often used by these labs.\\nLife Sciences and Diagnostics Measurement Products and Applications\\nOur products fall into twelve main areas of work: liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, lab automation and robotics, automated electrophoresis, NMR systems, life sciences consumables and services, pathology products, specific proteins and flow reagents, target enrichment, cytogenetic research solutions and  microarrays, and PCR & qPCR instrumentation and molecular biology reagents. Our key product and applications include the following technologies:\\nLiquid Chromatography\\nA liquid chromatograph or a high performance liquid chromatograph (\"HPLC\") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. The Agilent LC portfolio is modular in construction and can be configured as analytical and preparative systems. These systems can be stepwise upgraded to highly sophisticated, automated workflow solutions such as method development, multi‑method/walk-up, high-capacity/high-throughput or multi‑dimensional LC and can be extended to application‑based analyzers e.g. for bio-molecular separations, chiral analysis or size exclusion chromatography. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns, new services and diagnostics offerings and ongoing instrument and software product enhancements.\\nMass Spectrometry\\nA mass spectrometer (\"MS\") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical\\'s molecular mass and characteristic patterns of fragment ion masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Liquid chromatography is commonly used to separate compounds and introduce them to the MS system. The combined use of LC and MS is frequently used both to identify and quantify chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing small molecules and can also be used to characterize and quantify proteins and other biological entities. Agilent\\'s LCMS portfolio includes instruments built around four main analyzer types - single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, time-of-flight (\"TOF\") and quadrupole time-of-flight (\"QTOF\"). We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry portfolio in recent years with a focus on improving performance, sensitivity, and ease of use.\\nSoftware and Informatics\\nWe provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics.

We have manufacturing facilities in California and Colorado in the U.S. Outside of the U.S. we have manufacturing facilities in China, Germany, Japan  and Malaysia.\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\nWe generally only manufacture products when we have received firm orders for delivery and do not generally hold large stocks of finished inventory.\\nElectronic Measurement Competition\\nThe market for electronic measurement equipment is highly competitive. Our electronic measurement business competes with a number of significant competitors in all our major product categories and across our targeted industries. In the communications test market our primary competitors are Aeroflex Incorporated, Anritsu Corporation, Ansoft Corporation (a subsidiary of Ansys Corporation), National Instruments Corporation, Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co. KG, Tektronix, Inc. (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation) and Teradyne, Inc. In the general purpose test market, we compete against companies such as Aeroflex Incorporated (recently acquired by Cobham plc), Bruker Corporation, Fluke Corporation (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation), Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, National Instruments Corporation, Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co. KG, Tektronix, Inc. (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation), Teradyne, Inc., Test Research Inc., and Ametek, Inc.\\nOur electronic measurement business offers a wide range of products, and these products compete primarily on the basis of product quality and functionality, as well as performance and reliability.\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories (\"Research Labs\") is our research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with offices in Europe and Asia. The Research Labs create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in Agilent\\'s core businesses and expanding Agilent\\'s measurement footprint into adjacent markets. At the cross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent\\'s businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value.\\nThe technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including biology, chemistry, computer science, distributed measurement, electrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, nano/microfabrication, microfluidics, software, informatics, optics, physics, physiology and signal processing.\\nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. Generally these organizations are centrally operated from Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2014, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 3,200 people worldwide.\\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organizations\\nBeginning in fiscal year 2014, we created the order fulfillment and supply chain organization (\"OFS\") to centralize all order fulfillment and supply chain operations in our life sciences and diagnostics and chemicals analysis businesses.  Similarly we created the order fulfillment and infrastructure (\"OFI\") organization to centralize all order fulfillment and supply organizations and operations within our electronic measurement business. Both OFS and OFI provide resources for manufacturing, engineering and strategic sourcing to our respective businesses. In general, OFS and OFI employees are dedicated to specific businesses and the associated costs are directly allocated to those businesses.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenditures were $719 million in 2014, $704 million in 2013 and $668 million in 2012, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services.\\nBacklog\\nBacklog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\nthat were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers.\\nOn October 31, 2014, our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately $430 million, as compared to approximately $380 million at October 31, 2013. Within our life sciences and diagnostics business, our unfilled backlog was approximately $530 million on October 31, 2014 as compared to approximately $520 million at October 31, 2013.\\nOn October 31, 2014, our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately $780 million, as compared to approximately $760 million at October 31, 2013. It is expected that the unfilled backlog will be fulfilled by Keysight  which separated from Agilent on November 1, 2014.\\nWe expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all businesses will be delivered to customers within six months. On average, our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months\\' worth of revenues. We believe backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. Our electronic measurement, chemical analysis, life sciences and diagnostics businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.\\nCertain properties transferred to Keysight as part of the separation are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\").   In addition, a subset of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located.  As part of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. In connection with the separation of Keysight, HP has agreed to transfer that indemnity to Keysight.  The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us prior to the separation of Keysight, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so, in which case Keysight may seek indemnification from us. It is also possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named under a remediation order.  The naming of Agilent will not affect HP\\'s obligation to indemnify us or Keysight with regard to these matters.  Under our agreement with HP and now HP\\'s agreement with Keysight, HP will have access\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nto those Keysight properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that operations will not be interrupted or that Keysight will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. We cannot be sure that Keysight will not seek additional reimbursement from us for that interference or unreimbursed costs.  Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP have been sold.\\nWe are liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nAccording to the separation agreement, we are liable and are indemnifying Keysight with respect to any liability associated with contamination prior to the separation at properties transferred by us to Keysight.  While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, other than the remediation by HP, there is no guarantee that such contamination does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe are being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.\\nAs part of our acquisition of Varian in 2010, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nWe maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 70 percent in fiscal 2014, 70 percent in fiscal 2013, and 68 percent in fiscal 2012, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were approximately 16 percent in fiscal 2014, 17 percent in fiscal 2013 and 16 percent in fiscal 2012. Approximately 9 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2014, 9 percent in fiscal 2013 and 10 percent in fiscal 2012 was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.\\nLong-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 58 percent in fiscal year 2014, 58 percent in fiscal year 2013 and 60 percent in fiscal year 2012. Approximately 13, 13 and 12 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.\\nMost of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nOur international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 21, \"Segment Information\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition and Disposal of Material Assets\\nOn September 19, 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies, one comprising of the life sciences, diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that will retain the Agilent name, and the other one that will be comprised of the electronic measurement business that will be renamed Keysight Technologies, Inc. (\"Keysight\"). Keysight was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent on December 6, 2013. On November 1, 2014, we completed the distribution of 100% of the outstanding common shares of Keysight to Agilent stockholders who received one share of Keysight common stock for every two shares of Agilent held as of the close of business on the record date, October 22, 2014.\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, Agilent announced that it is exiting its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business (\"NMR\"). Agilent will stop taking new NMR system orders, but the company will continue to meet customer commitments for orders in progress and for ongoing support contracts and continue to provide service on all installed NMR systems. The company expects that this decision will eliminate about 300 jobs, mostly within the next 12 months.\\nOn June 21, 2012, we acquired Dako through the purchase of 100% of the share capital of Dako, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Denmark, under the share purchase agreement, dated May 16, 2012. Dako provides antibodies, reagents, scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories. As a result of the acquisition, Dako has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The consideration paid was approximately $2.143 billion, of which $1.4 billion was paid directly to the seller and $743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of Dako.  Agilent funded the acquisition using our existing cash.\\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nHenrik Ancher-Jensen,\\n49, has served as Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment since September 2013.

       "  'text': 'ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nDepressed and uncertain general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to negative changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. The continued economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n-  reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;\\n-  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n-  increased price pressure for our products and services; and\\n-  greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\n18\\nTable of Contents\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions, including declines related to the current market disruptions described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n-  properly identify customer needs;\\n-  innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n-  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n-  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;\\n-  differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n-  price our products competitively;\\n-  anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n-  control product quality in our manufacturing process.\\nWe are pursuing a plan to spin-off our electronic measurement business into a new, independent publicly traded company.  The proposed separation may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or at all and may not achieve the intended benefits.\\nI\\nn September 2013, we announced a plan to separate into two independent public companies through a spin-off of our electronic measurement business.  Unanticipated developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax rulings, regulatory approvals or clearances and trade qualifications, uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes, could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected.  Even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spin-off.  Expenses incurred to accomplish the proposed separation may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate.  Executing the proposed separation also requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business.  Following the proposed separation, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to reflect market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work.\\n19\\nTable of Contents\\nShould a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n-  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n-  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n-  changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n-  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n-  negative consequences from changes in tax laws including changes to U.S. tax legislation that could materially increase our effective tax rate;\\n-  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n-  differing labor regulations;\\n-  differing protection of intellectual property;\\n-  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n-  geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.\\nWe centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nAdditionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. See Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\". If government action results from our China investigation, we could face possible fines and penalties, criminal or civil sanctions, or other consequences, and our business could suffer.\\nIn addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nSignificant key customers or large orders may expose us to additional business and legal risks that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\\nCertain significant key customers have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us.  These customers may demand contract terms that differ considerably from our standard terms and conditions.  Large orders may also include severe contractual liabilities for us if we fail to provide the quantity and quality of product at the required delivery times.  While we attempt to contractually limit our potential liability under such contracts, we expect to be forced to agree to some or all of these types of provisions to secure these orders and to continue to grow our business.  Such actions expose us to significant additional risks which could result in a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees, especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example in the past we completed various acquisitions, including Dako A/S, Halo Genomics AB and the test systems division of AT4 wireless. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:\\n-  the retention of key employees;\\n-  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n-  the retention of key customers;\\n-  the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company; and\\n-  the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company.\\nIn addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n-  effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n-  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n-  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.\\nIn addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\nrequire varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nIf we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition and integration of Dako A/S, our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition and integration of Dako. In addition, the operation of Dako within Agilent could be a costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\\n-  difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel;\\n-  increased exposure to certain governmental regulations and compliance requirements;\\n-  the potential loss of key personnel who choose not to remain with Dako or Agilent;\\n-  the potential loss of key customers or suppliers who choose not to do business with the combined business; and\\n-  the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on additional investment or research and development activities in excess of our current expectations, which could offset any synergies resulting from the Dako acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding debt.\\nEven if we are able to successfully operate Dako within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\\n-  the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected;\\n-  the possibility that we may not be able to expand the reach and customer base for Dako current and future products as expected;\\n-  the possibility that we may not be able to expand the reach and customer base for Agilent products as expected;\\n-  the possibility that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets may not be recoverable;\\nand\\n-  the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our diagnostics business, and we may not experience anticipated growth in that market.\\nAs a result of these risks, the Dako acquisition and integration may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected revenue synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.\\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. For instance, Danaher Corporation completed its acquisition of IRIS International in November 2012; Thermo Fisher Scientific announced its acquisition of Life Technologies in April 2013 and completed its acquisitions of  Doe & Ingalls in May 2012 and One Lambda in September 2012; and PerkinElmer completed its acquisition of Haoyuan Biotech in November 2012. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations and result in stronger competitors, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with or changes in such regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products. We develop, configure and\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nmarket our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products, force us to modify our products to comply with new regulations or increase our costs of producing these products. If demand for our products is adversely affected or our costs increase, our business would suffer.\\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nSome of our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics products are exposed to particular complex regulations such as regulations of toxic substances and medical devices, and failure to comply with such regulations could harm our business.\\nSome of our chemical analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics businesses are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must conform the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nA number of our products from our chemical analysis and life sciences and diagnostics businesses are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  These regulations govern a wide variety of product related activities, from quality management, design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products.\\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting. On March 4, 2013, we made a report to the Inspector General of the Department of Defense regarding pricing irregularities relating to certain sales of electronic measurement products to U.S. government agencies.  See Item 3. \"Legal Proceedings\". If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nfunctions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.\\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins, and operating results.\\nDemand for some of our products and services depends on capital spending policies of our customers and on government funding policies.\\nOur customers include pharmaceutical companies, laboratories, universities, healthcare providers, government agencies and public and private research institutions. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services.  Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources, mergers and consolidation, spending priorities, institutional and governmental budgetary policies and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. These policies in turn can have a significant effect on the demand for our products and services. If demand for our products and services is adversely affected, our revenue and operating results would suffer.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nSome of our properties are undergoing remediation by the Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.\\nWe have agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us, other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.\\nOur current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nstandards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\\nAs part of our acquisition of Varian, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nNew regulations related to \"conflict minerals\" may cause us to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing our products.\\nOn August 22, 2012, the SEC adopted a new rule requiring disclosures by public companies of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. The new rule, which went into effect for calendar year 2013 and requires a disclosure report to be filed with the SEC by May 31, 2014, will require companies to perform due diligence, disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tin, gold and tungsten. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to the due diligence process of determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. As our supply chain is complex and we use contract manufacturers for some of our products, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nof intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.\\nOur pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nAgilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted Agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Agilent\\'s taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If Agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States while most of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nAlthough the cash generated in the United States from our operations covers our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations, our stock repurchase program, our declared dividends and acquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.6 billion in senior unsecured notes and a $46 million secured mortgage. We also are a party to a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in October 2016 and under which we may borrow up to $400 million and a Danish Krone denominated credit facility equivalent to $9 million. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.\\nOur incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n-  increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n-  requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases; and\\n-  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\\nOur current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\\nAs of October 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.68 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Item 1.    Business\\nOverview\\nAgilent Technologies, Inc. (\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is the world\\'s premier measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences, diagnostics and genomics, chemical analysis, communications and electronics industries.\\nOn September 19, 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies, one comprising of the life sciences, diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses that will retain the Agilent name and the other that will be comprised of the electronic measurement business (\"EM\"). The separation is expected to occur through a tax-free pro rata spin off of the EM company to Agilent shareholders and is expected to be completed early in November 2014. We expect to incur pre-separation expenses of $100 million in fiscal 2014.\\nIn addition to the announcement to separate into two companies, we formed a new operating segment in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2013. The new life sciences and diagnostics segment was formed by the combination of the life sciences business plus the diagnostics and genomics business. Following this reorganization, Agilent has three business segments comprised of the life sciences and diagnostics business, the chemical analysis business and the electronic measurement business.  The historical segment financial information for the life sciences and diagnostics segment has been recast to conform to this new reporting structure in our financial statements.\\nOur life sciences and diagnostics business focuses on the pharmaceutical, academic and government, bio-agriculture, food safety, clinical markets, biotechnology and contract research organization industries. Our chemical analysis business focuses on the petrochemical, environmental, forensics and food safety industries. Our electronic measurement business addresses the communications, electronics and other industries. In addition to our three businesses, we conduct centralized manufacturing and order fulfillment through Agilent Order Fulfillment (\"AOF\") as well as research through Agilent Technologies Laboratories (\"Agilent Labs\"). Each of our three businesses, AOF and Agilent Labs, is supported by our global infrastructure organization, which provides shared services in the areas of finance, information technology, legal, workplace services and human resources.\\nOn June 21, 2012, we acquired Dako through the purchase of 100% of the share capital of Dako, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Denmark, under the share purchase agreement, dated May 16, 2012. Dako provides antibodies, reagents, scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories. As a result of the acquisition, Dako has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The consideration paid was approximately $2,143 million, of which $1,400 million was paid directly to the seller and $743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of Dako.  Agilent funded the acquisition using existing cash.\\nWe sell our products primarily through direct sales, but we also utilize distributors, resellers, manufacturer\\'s representatives, telesales and electronic commerce. Of our total net revenue of $6.8 billion for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013, we generated 30 percent in the U.S. and 70 percent outside the U.S. As of October 31, 2013, we employed approximately 20,600 people\\n3\\nTable of Contents\\nworldwide. Our primary research and development and manufacturing sites are in California, Colorado and Delaware in the U.S. and in Australia, China, Denmark, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\\nThe net revenue, income from operations and assets by business segment, as of and for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2013 and for each of the past three years are shown in Note 21, \"Segment Information\", to our consolidated financial statements, which we incorporate by reference herein.\\nLife Sciences and Diagnostics Business\\nOur life sciences and diagnostics business provides application-focused solutions that include reagents, instruments, software, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography (\"LC\") systems, columns and components; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (\"LCMS\") systems; laboratory software and informatics systems; laboratory automation and robotic systems; dissolution testing; nucleic acid solutions; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (\"NMR\"), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (\"MRI\"), and X-Ray Diffraction (\"XRD\") systems; services and support for the aforementioned products;  immunohistochemistry (\"IHC\"); In Situ Hybridization (\"ISH\");  Hematoxylin and Eosin (\"H&E\") staining; special staining, DNA mutation detection; genotyping; gene copy number determination; identification of gene rearrangements; DNA methylation profiling; gene expression profiling; next generation sequencing (\"NGS\") target enrichment; and automated gel electrophoresis-based sample analysis systems. We also collaborate with a number of major pharmaceutical companies to develop new potential pharmacodiagnostics, also called companion diagnostics, with the potential of identifying patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy.\\nWe employed approximately 6,100 people as of October 31, 2013 in our life sciences and diagnostics business. This business generated revenue of $2.3 billion in fiscal 2013, $2.0 billion in fiscal 2012 and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2011.\\nLife Sciences and Diagnostics Markets\\nOur life sciences and diagnostics business focuses primarily on the following three markets:\\nThe Pharma, Biotech, CRO & CMO Market.\\nThis market consists of \"for-profit\" companies who participate across the pharmaceutical value chain in the areas of therapeutic research, discovery & development, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control. One sub-segment of this market is core and emerging pharmaceutical companies (\"pharma\"). A second sub-segment includes biotechnology companies (\"biotech\"), contract research organizations (\"CROs\") and contract manufacturing organizations (\"CMOs\"). Biotech companies and, to a somewhat lesser extent, CROs and CMOs typically participate in specific points in the pharmaceutical industry value chain. Additionally, due to the relatively low drug efficacy within oncology, pharma companies are partnering with diagnostic companies to bring validated tests to the market with their new drugs.\\nThe Academic and Government Market.\\nThis market consists primarily of \"not-for-profit\" organizations and includes academic institutions, large government institutes and privately funded organizations. The academic and government research market plays an influential role in technology adoption and therapeutic developments for pharmaceutical and molecular diagnostics companies. After decades of investment in basic biomedical research by government funding bodies, the focus has widened to include translational research - multidisciplinary scientific efforts directed at accelerating therapy development.\\nThe Clinical Market\\n.   A significant part of our clinical diagnostic customers are in pathology labs throughout the world.  Our high-quality, automated pathology tissue staining platforms and solutions are used most heavily by the large labs located in hospitals, medical centers, and reference labs.  The market is skewed towards the mature economies, with approximately 75% of the market in North America, Western Europe and Japan.  The mix is changing, however, as emerging markets increase spending on human health.\\nThe clinical market for genomics consists of high complexity clinical labs performing patient testing, including \"for-profit\" reference laboratories, hospital labs, and molecular diagnostic companies. While these labs primarily purchase in vitro diagnostics (\"IVD\") labeled testing kits, they often develop and validate their own molecular based tests. Analyte Specific Reagents (\"ASRs\") are often used by these labs.\\nLife Sciences and Diagnostics Measurement Products and Applications\\nOur products fall into eleven main areas of work: liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, software and informatics, lab automation and robotics, automated electrophoresis, NMR and MRI systems, life sciences consumables and services, pathology products, specific proteins and flow reagents, target enrichment, cytogenetic research solutions and  microarrays. Our key product\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nsegments include:\\nLiquid Chromatography Products\\nA liquid chromatograph or a high performance liquid chromatograph (\"HPLC\") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. The Agilent LC portfolio is modular in construction and can be configured as analytical and preparative systems. These systems can be stepwise upgraded to highly sophisticated, automated workflow solutions such as method development, multi‑method/walk-up, high-capacity/high-throughput or multi‑dimensional LC and can be extended to application‑based analyzers e.g. for bio-molecular separations, chiral analysis or size exclusion chromatography. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns, new services and diagnostics offerings and ongoing instrument and software product enhancements.\\nMass Spectrometry Products\\nA mass spectrometer (\"MS\") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical\\'s molecular mass and characteristic patterns of fragment ion masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Liquid chromatography is commonly used to separate compounds and introduce them to the MS system. The combined use of LC and MS is frequently used both to identify and quantify chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing small molecules and can also be used to characterize and quantify proteins and other biological entities. Agilent\\'s LCMS portfolio includes instruments built around four main analyzer types - single quadrupole, triple quadrupole, time-of-flight (\"TOF\") and quadrupole time-of-flight (\"QTOF\"). We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry portfolio in recent years with a focus on improving performance, sensitivity, and ease of use.\\nSoftware and Informatics Products\\nWe provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics. Our software facilitates the regulatory‑compliant use of instruments in pharmaceutical quality assurance/quality control environments. With OpenLab Laboratory Software Suite, Agilent has a scalable, open software platform that enables customers to capture, analyze, and share scientific data throughout the lab and across the enterprise.\\nLab Automation and Robotics\\nWe offer a comprehensive suite of workflow solutions to our life science customers with the addition of automated liquid handling and robotics that range from standalone instrumentation to bench-top automation solutions to large, multi‑armed robotic systems. These solutions strengthen our offering of automated sample‑preparation solutions across a broad range of applications. In fiscal 2012 we acquired AssayMAP technology, which in combination with Agilent\\'s Bravo liquid handling platform enables highly parallel automated microchromatography for protein purification and characterization. In 2011, Agilent acquired a technology that provides high throughput sample introduction devices (Rapid Fire) for LCMS to expand capability to run ultra-short analysis in an automated manner.\\nAutomated Electrophoresis and Microfluidics\\nAutomated electrophoresis is a separation technique for bio molecules such as proteins, peptides and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA) and is used to determine the identity of a molecule by either size or charge. It is widely used as a QC tool to check sample integrity prior to subsequent analysis.  Prominent examples are nucleic acid preparation products in front of polymerase chain reaction, NGS and microarrays.\\nNMR, MRI and XRD systems\\nNMR, spectrometers, MRI systems and XRD systems are used in a variety of industries including academic and not-for-profit research, life sciences (pharma and biotech), and industrial companies. All of these technologies are utilized for basic and applied research, and NMR is also used in process development and manufacturing QA/QC. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we announced the termination of our involvement in MRI systems.\\nLife Sciences Consumables and Services\\nWe also offer a broad range of consumable products, which support our LC and MS technology platforms. These consumable products include sample preparation products; self-manufactured LC columns, instrument replacement parts, and consumable supplies to meet our customers\\' analysis needs. All of our products are designed to Agilent\\'s specifications to improve and maximize the performance of our instruments.\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nWe offer a wide range of startup, operational, educational and compliance support services for our measurement and data handling systems. Our support services include maintenance, troubleshooting, repair and training for all of our chemical and bioinstrumentation analysis hardware and software products. Special service bundles have also been designed to meet the specific application needs of various industries.\\nPathology Products\\nThis area consists of routine clinical solutions for tissue based cancer diagnostics with solutions that comprise antibodies, reagents, instruments and software targeting both primary and advanced cancer diagnostics. Our CoverStainer and Artisan based product families target primary cancer diagnostics through Hematoxylin and Eosin staining as well as Special Stains for additional insights and detection of potentially carcinogenic tissue. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched our new combined IHC/ISH platform, Dako Omnis. The Dako Omnis and Autostainer based IHC solution and Instant Quality Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (\"IQFISH\") technologies provide advanced tumor typing through investigation of protein and gene expression. These products also include companion diagnostic tests that are used to help identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy.\\nSpecific Proteins and Flow Reagents\\nOur reagent OEM business is a provider of clinical diagnostic products within the areas of specific proteins for turbidimetry and reagents for flow cytometry. These are sold OEM as customized reagent solutions supplied to top IVD companies or through retail partners.\\nTarget Enrichment\\nAgilent continues to be a strong player in the next generation sequencing market. We provide a target enrichment portfolio composed of two main platforms, SureSelect and HaloPlex, both enabling customers to select specific target regions of the genome for sequencing. Customers can customize our products for their regions of interest using the SureDesign software, or they can choose from a wide range of catalog products, including gene panels for specific applications and Exome designs, which allow analysis of the entire coding sequences of the genome. After preparing samples with SureSelect and HaloPlex, products can be sequenced in the main next generation sequencing platforms available in the market. The technologies provide an easy sample prep workflow that can be automated with Agilent Bravo platform for scalability. HaloPlex provides less-than-24-hours fast workflow, which makes it suitable for labs that require fast turnaround time from sample to results. These products are used for mutation detection and genotyping. Results can be easily analyzed using Agilent software solutions GeneSpring or SureCall.\\nCytogenetic Research Solutions and Microarrays\\nAgilent is a leading provider of microarrays for Comparative Genomic Hybridization (\"CGH\"), mostly used by customers in cytogenetic laboratories.  The arrays allow customers to detect genome-wide copy number alterations, with high levels of resolution (from entire chromosomal copy number changes to specific microdeletions or duplications). The arrays are offered in many formats allowing the customers to choose from different levels of resolution and number of samples per arrays. Arrays can also be customized using the SureDesign software. In addition to the microarrays, Agilent\\'s solution includes reagents for sample processing, hardware for reading the microarrays, and software to help users view the data in a meaningful way.  In addition to the CGH portfolio, the cytogenetics solution comprises a line of oligonucleotide probes for Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (\\'FISH\\') called SureFISH. Over 400 probes are available in our catalog, covering most relevant regions in the genome. Cytogenetic labs can use SureFISH probes to detect specific translocations or copy number changes in samples. Additionally, Agilent provides a wide range of microarrays to the research market for different types of applications: gene expression, microRNA, methylation, splice variants, and chromatin immunoprecipitation applications. Arrays are offered as catalog designs or customizable designs, with no minimum order size and short delivery time, which differentiates us from other vendors and enables researchers the maximum flexibility in their studies.  Our end-to-end solution includes reagents for sample preparation and microarray processing; hardware for sample QC and high-throughput microarray scanning; microarrays on industry-standard 1\" × 3\" glass slides for key applications; custom microarray design services; and GeneSpring software products for data analysis.\\nPCR & qPCR Instrumentation and Molecular Biology Reagents\\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (\"PCR\") is a standard laboratory method used to amplify the amount of genetic material of a given sample to enable further interrogation.  Quantitative PCR (\"qPCR\") or real time PCR is also a standard method used in genomic research facilities to measure the amount of a specific nucleic acid sequence within a sample.  There are several applications for qPCR, among the most common are identifying the expression level of a specific gene, or calculating the amount of a specific pathogen present in a sample. Agilent offers a complete portfolio of PCR & qPCR instruments, as well as specialty enzymes for\\n6\\nTable of Contents\\namplifying difficult sample types. In addition to PCR and qPCR enzymes, Agilent offers a wide range of molecular biology reagents including tools for cloning and mutagenesis applications.\\nLife Sciences and Diagnostics Customers\\nWe had over 46,000 customers for our life sciences and diagnostics business in 2013. No single customer represented a material amount of the net revenue of the life sciences and diagnostics business. A significant number of our life sciences and diagnostics customers are also customers of our chemical analysis business.\\nThe life sciences and diagnostics business is susceptible to seasonality in its orders and revenues primarily based on U.S. and foreign government budgets and large pharmaceutical company budgets. In general, the result is that our third and fourth fiscal quarters tend to deliver the strongest profits for this group. The diagnostics business is generally a fairly stable business impacted primarily by local holidays. However, general economic trends, new product introductions and competition might overshadow this trend in any given year.\\nLife Sciences and Diagnostics Sales, Marketing and Support\\nThe life science and diagnostics channels focus on the therapeutics and human disease research customer base (pharma, biotech, CRO, CMO and generics), clinical customer base (pathology labs and high complexity clinical testing labs) and on emerging life sciences opportunities in academic and government life science research institutes. We deploy a multi-channel approach, marketing products to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers, manufacturers\\' representatives and distributors. We primarily use direct sales to market our solutions to our pharmaceutical, biopharmaceutical and clinical accounts. Sales agents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our customers. We sell our consumable products through distributors, telesales, electronic commerce and direct sales. We utilize telesales for more mature product lines, as well as for reorders of reagent products.\\nWe deliver our support services to customers in a variety of ways, including on-site assistance with repair or exchange of returned products, telephone support and self-diagnostic services provided over the Internet.

KG, Tektronix, Inc. (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation), Teradyne, Inc., Test Research Inc., and Zygo Corporation.\\nOur electronic measurement business offers a wide range of products, and these products compete primarily on the basis of product quality and functionality, as well as performance and reliability.\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories (\"Research Labs\") is our research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with offices in Europe and Asia. The Research Labs create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in Agilent\\'s core businesses and expanding Agilent\\'s measurement footprint into adjacent markets. At the\\n13\\nTable of Contents\\ncross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent\\'s businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value.\\nThe technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including biology, chemistry, computer science, distributed measurement, electrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, nano/microfabrication, microfluidics, software, informatics, optics, physics, physiology and signal processing. As of the end of October 2013, Research Labs employed approximately 210 personnel worldwide.\\nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. Generally these organizations are centrally operated from Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2013, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,200 people worldwide.\\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organization\\nBeginning in fiscal year 2012, we created the Agilent Order Fulfillment organization to centralize all order fulfillment and supply organizations and operations.  AOF leverages our strength in manufacturing, engineering, strategic sourcing and logistics for life sciences and diagnostics, chemical analysis and electronic measurement businesses. In general, AOF employees are dedicated to specific businesses and business headcount numbers include AOF employees.  In the fourth quarter of 2013 we announced that the AOF organization had been divided into two separate operations; one dedicated to the life sciences, diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses and one dedicated to the electronic measurement business.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenditures were $704 million in 2013, $668 million in 2012 and $649 million in 2011, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services. We remain committed to invest approximately 10 percent of revenues in research and development and have focused our development efforts on key strategic opportunities in order to align our business with available markets and position ourselves to capture market share.\\nBacklog\\nBacklog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods that were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers.\\nOn October 31, 2013, our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately $760 million, as compared to approximately $800 million at October 31, 2012. On October 31, 2013, our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately $380 million, as compared to approximately $360 million at October 31, 2012. Within our life sciences and diagnostics business, our unfilled backlog was approximately $520 million on October 31, 2013 as compared to approximately $530 million at October 31, 2012. We expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six months. On average, our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months\\' worth of revenues. We believe backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\n14\\nTable of Contents\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. Our electronic measurement, chemical analysis, life sciences and diagnostics businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.\\nSome of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\"). As part of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP have been sold.\\nIn addition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect HP\\'s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.\\nWe are liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe are being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.\\nAs part of our acquisition of Varian in 2010, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nor VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nWe maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 70 percent in fiscal 2013, 68 percent in fiscal 2012, and 70 percent in fiscal 2011, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were approximately 17 percent in fiscal 2013 and 16 percent in fiscal 2012 and 2011. Approximately 9 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2013, 10 percent in fiscal 2012 and 11 percent in fiscal 2011 was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.\\nLong-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 58 percent in fiscal year 2013, 60 percent in fiscal year 2012 and 56 percent in fiscal year 2011. Approximately 9, 12 and 13 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.\\nMost of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 21, \"Segment Information\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition of Material Assets\\nOn June 21, 2012, we acquired Dako through the purchase of 100% of the share capital of Dako, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Denmark, under the share purchase agreement, dated May 16, 2012. Dako provides antibodies, reagents, scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories. As a result of the acquisition, Dako has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The consideration paid was approximately $2.143 billion, of which $1.4 billion was paid directly to the seller and $743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of Dako.  Agilent funded the acquisition using our existing cash.\\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nHenrik Ancher-Jensen,\\n48, has served as Senior Vice President, Agilent and President, Order Fulfillment since September 2013.

KG, Tektronix, Inc. (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation), Teradyne, Inc., Test Research Inc., and Zygo Corporation.\\nOur electronic measurement business offers a wide range of products, and these products compete primarily on the basis of product quality and functionality, as well as performance and reliability.\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories (\"Research Labs\") is our research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with offices in Europe and China. The Research Labs create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in Agilent\\'s core businesses and expanding Agilent\\'s measurement footprint into adjacent markets. At the cross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent\\'s businesses to create competitive differentiation and compelling customer value.\\nThe technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including biology, chemistry, computer science, distributed measurement, electrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, nano/microfabrication, microfluidics, software, informatics, optics, physics, physiology and signal processing. As of the end of October 2012, Research Labs employed approximately 250 personnel worldwide.\\nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. Generally these organizations are centrally operated from Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of October 2012, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 3,000 people worldwide including Research Labs.\\nAgilent Order Fulfillment Organization\\nBeginning in fiscal year 2012, we created the Agilent Order Fulfillment organization to centralize all order fulfillment and supply organizations and operations.  AOF leverages our strength in manufacturing, engineering, strategic sourcing and logistics for life sciences, chemical analysis and electronic measurement businesses. In general, AOF employees are dedicated to specific businesses and business headcount numbers include AOF employees.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenditures were $668 million in 2012, $649 million in 2011 and $612 million in 2010, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services.\\nBacklog\\nBacklog represents the amount of revenue expected from orders that have already been booked, including orders for goods and services that have not been delivered to customers, orders invoiced but not yet recognized as revenue, and orders for goods\\n15\\nTable of Contents\\nthat were shipped but not invoiced, awaiting acceptance by customers. Backlog amounts have been restated for the year ended October 31, 2011 to conform to this definition.\\nOn October 31, 2012, our unfilled backlog for the electronic measurement business was approximately $800 million, as compared to approximately $850 million at October 31, 2011. On October 31, 2012, our unfilled backlog for the chemical analysis business was approximately $360 million, as compared to approximately $320 million at October 31, 2011. Within our life sciences business, our unfilled backlog was approximately $500 million on October 31, 2012 as compared to approximately $490 million at October 31, 2011. On October 31, 2012, our unfilled backlog for the diagnostics and genomics business was approximately $30 million, as compared to approximately $30 million at October 31, 2011. We expect that a majority of the unfilled backlog for all four businesses will be delivered to customers within six months. On average, our unfilled backlog represents approximately three months\\' worth of revenues. We believe backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and sheet metal. Our electronic measurement, chemical analysis, life sciences and diagnostics and genomics businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.\\nSome of our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\"). As part of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP have been sold.\\nIn addition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which\\n16\\nTable of Contents\\nthe property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us with respect to such subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect HP\\'s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.\\nWe are liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated to indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe are being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.\\nAs part of our acquisition of Varian in 2010, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nWe maintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This policy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 68 percent in fiscal 2012, 70 percent in fiscal 2011, and 68 percent in fiscal 2010, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were approximately 16 percent in fiscal 2012 and 2011 and 14 percent in fiscal 2010. Approximately 10 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2012, 11 percent in fiscal 2011 and 10 percent in fiscal 2010 was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.\\nLong-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 60 percent in fiscal year 2012, 56 percent in fiscal year 2011 and 52 percent in fiscal year 2010. Approximately 12, 13 and 13 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.\\nMost of our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant\\n17\\nTable of Contents\\nmanufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 21, \"Segment Information\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition of Material Assets\\nOn June 21, 2012, we acquired Dako through the purchase of 100% of the share capital of Dako, a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Denmark, under the share purchase agreement, dated May 16, 2012. Dako provides antibodies, reagents, scientific instruments and software primarily to customers in pathology laboratories. As a result of the acquisition, Dako has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent. The consideration paid was approximately $2.143 billion, of which $1.4 billion was paid directly to the seller and $743 million was paid to satisfy the outstanding debt of Dako.  Agilent funded the acquisition using our existing cash.\\nOn May 14, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Varian, Inc., a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications, for a total cash purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. Varian\\'s products include analytical instruments, research products and related software, consumable products, accessories and services, as well as vacuum products and related services and accessories. The acquisition broadens Agilent\\'s applications and solutions offerings in life sciences, environmental, and energy and materials. It also expands Agilent\\'s product portfolio into atomic and molecular spectroscopy; establishes a leading position in nuclear magnetic resonance, imaging and vacuum technologies; and strengthens our consumables portfolio. We financed the purchase price of Varian using the proceeds from our September 2009 offering of senior notes and other existing cash. Varian\\'s cash acquired at completion of the acquisition was approximately $226 million.\\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nSolange Glaize,\\n48, has served as our Vice President, Corporate Controllership and Chief Accounting Officer since March, 2012.

       "  'text': 'Item 1A.  Risk Factors\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nDepressed general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. An economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n-  reduced demand for our products, delays in the shipment of orders, or increases in order cancellations;\\n-  increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n-  increased price pressure for our products and services; and\\n-  greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions, including declines related to the current market disruptions described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our operating margins.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n-  properly identify customer needs;\\n-  innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n-  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n-  manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;\\n-  differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n-  price our products competitively;\\n-  anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n-  control product quality in our manufacturing process.\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we outsource aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. Additionally, changing or replacing our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers could cause disruptions or delays. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information technology (\"IT\") and other administrative\\n20\\nTable of Contents\\nfunctions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of our IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage the consolidation and streamlining of our manufacturing operations, we may not achieve desired efficiencies and our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted.\\nAlthough we utilize manufacturing facilities throughout the world, we have been consolidating, and may continue to consolidate, our manufacturing operations to certain of our plants to achieve efficiencies and gross margin improvements. Additionally, we typically consolidate the production of products from our acquisitions into our supply chain and manufacturing processes, which are technically complex and require expertise to operate. If we are unable to establish processes to efficiently and effectively produce high quality products in the consolidated locations, we may not achieve the anticipated synergies and production may be disrupted, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have seen a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner which could lead to order cancellations, contract breaches or indemnification obligations. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income, margins, and operating results.\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n-  interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n-  changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n-  changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n-  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n-  negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\\n-  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n-  differing labor regulations;\\n-  differing protection of intellectual property;\\n21\\nTable of Contents\\n-  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n-  geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war.\\nWe centralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts receivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nAdditionally, we must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions on our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international operations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\\nIn addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party financial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees, especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, during fiscal 2010, we closed our acquisition of Varian, Inc. and the sale of our Network Solutions Division. During fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisitions of A2 Technologies, Lab901 and Biocius Life Sciences Inc. During fiscal 2012, we completed various acquisitions, including Dako A/S, BioSystem Development LLC, Halo Genomics AB, the test systems division of AT4 wireless, and the test and measurement businesses of Centellax Inc. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:\\n-  the retention of key employees;\\n-  the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n-  the retention of key customers;\\n-  the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company; and\\n-  the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company.\\nIn addition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nprevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses is likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n-  effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n-  identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n-  reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business.\\nIn addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nIf we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition of Dako A/S, our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition of Dako. In addition, the operation of Dako within Agilent could be a costly and time-consuming process that involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\\n-  difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel;\\n-  the potential loss of key personnel who choose not to remain with Dako or Agilent;\\n-  the potential loss of key customers or suppliers who choose not to do business with the combined business; and\\n-  the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on additional investment or research and development activities in excess of our current expectations, which could offset any synergies resulting from the Dako acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and retirement of outstanding debt.\\nEven if we are able to successfully operate Dako within Agilent, we may not be able to realize the revenue and other synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in the time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\\n-  the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected;\\n-  the possibility that we may not be able to expand the reach and customer base for Dako current and future products as expected;\\n-  the possibility that we may not be able to expand the reach and customer base for Agilent products as expected;\\n-  the possibility that the carrying amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets may not be recoverable;\\nand\\n-  the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our diagnostics business, and we may not experience anticipated growth in that market.\\nAs a result of these risks, the Dako acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected revenue synergies or our return on invested capital targets when expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.\\nThe impact of consolidation and acquisitions of competitors is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation. For instance, Danaher Corporation completed its acquisitions of Beckman Coulter, Inc. in June 2011 and IRIS\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nInternational in November 2012; Thermo Fisher Scientific completed its acquisitions of Phadia in August 2011, Doe & Ingalls in May 2012, and One Lambda in September 2012; and PerkinElmer completed its acquisitions of Haoyuan Biotech in November 2012 and Caliper Life Sciences in November 2011. Consolidation in our industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in increasingly consolidated industries and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nSome of our properties are undergoing remediation by the Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\") for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.\\nWe have agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us, other than those properties currently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination may exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.\\nOur current and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the environment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor related businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related to those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to regulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\\nAs part of our acquisition of Varian, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such costs) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\ncould also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.\\nOur products and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies such as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nSome of our chemical analysis products and related consumables marked by our chemical analysis and life sciences businesses are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances. We must conform the manufacturing, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all applicable countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, , then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing or marketing our products until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nA number of our products from our life sciences, chemical analysis and diagnostics and genomics businesses are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies.  As such, we continually invest in our manufacturing infrastructure to gain and maintain certifications necessary for the level of clearance. Our pathology manufacturing facilities in Denmark and California have established quality management systems and manufacturing practices designed to comply with the adequate standards for the in vitro diagnostics industry, including ISO 13485 Medical devices and FDA 21CFR Part 820 quality system regulation as well as additional international standards. Our genomics Cedar Creek, Texas manufacturing facility has been registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturing facility. This FDA registered facility is the site where our class I ASR SureFISH products are manufactured. Additionally, other facilities maintain ISO 13485 manufacturing compliance. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers, investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products.\\nOur business may suffer if we fail to comply with government contracting laws and regulations.\\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from direct and indirect sales to U.S., state, local, and foreign governments and their respective agencies. Such contracts are subject to various procurement laws and regulations, and contract provisions relating to their formation, administration and performance. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations or provisions in our government contracts could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, or suspension from future government contracting. If our government contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our business could suffer.\\nOur retirement and post retirement pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\\nWe have significant retirement and post retirement pension plans assets and obligations. The performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant decreases in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets will increase our funding obligations, and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We analyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents\\n25\\nTable of Contents\\nor other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products, which would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology, including technology we obtained through acquisitions. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.\\nOur pending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination by the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various jurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require considerable estimates and judgments. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax liabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties from what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nAgilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions have granted Agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income. Agilent\\'s taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If Agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax incentives.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States while most of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nAlthough the cash generated in the United States from our operations covers our normal operating requirements and debt service requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the maturity of our debt obligations, including our senior notes coming due in July 2013, our stock repurchase program, our declared dividends and\\n26\\nTable of Contents\\nacquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through (1) the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or (2) other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.25 billion in senior unsecured notes and a $44 million secured mortgage. We also are a party to a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in October, 2016 and under which we may borrow up to $400 million and a Danish Krone denominated credit facility equivalent to $9 million. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.\\nOur incurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n-  increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n-  requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases; and\\n-  limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\\nOur current revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur indebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture governing our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. If such a disruption were to occur, we could breach agreements, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, since we have consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to self-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in\\n27\\nTable of Contents\\nthe misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\\nAs of October 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.35 billion invested or held in a mix of money market funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. Disruptions in the financial markets may, in some cases, result in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Item 1A.    Risk Factors\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nDepressed general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. An economic downturn may\\nadversely impact our business resulting in:\\n- reduced demand for our products and increases in order cancellations;\\n- increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n- increased price pressure for our products and services;\\n- reduced access to the credit markets to meet short term cash needs in the U.S.; and\\n- greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of\\norders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast and may be cancelled by our customers. In addition,\\nour revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the\\nseasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions, including declines related to the current market disruptions described above, would\\nlikely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, we experienced weakness in almost all sectors during 2009 due to declines in market activity caused largely by the\\ncontinued global economic downturn. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our\\nelectronic measurement business. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position,\\nresults of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of\\nour operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further\\nreduce our operating margins.\\n22\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=22,EFW=\"2206674\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=1025266,FOLIO=\\'22\\',FILE=\\'DISK123:[11ZDX1.11ZDX75601]DE75601A.;10\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'15-DEC-2011;21:23\\' \\n THIS IS THE END OF A COMPOSITION COMPONENT \\n \\n COMMAND=ADD_BASECOLOR,\"Black\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_DEFAULTFONT,\"font-family:times;\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_TABLESHADECOLOR,\"#CCEEFF\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_STABLERULES,\"border-bottom:solid #000000 1.0pt;\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_DTABLERULES,\"border-bottom:double #000000 2.25pt;\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_SCRTABLERULES,\"border-bottom:solid #000000 1.0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_DCRTABLERULES,\"border-bottom:double #000000 2.25pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" \\n PARA=JUSTIFY\\nTOC_END \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service\\nintroductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and\\nenhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will\\ndepend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n- properly identify customer needs;\\n- innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;\\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n- price our products competitively;\\n- anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control product quality in our manufacturing process.Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our\\nreputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and\\nother functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality\\nlevels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which\\nmay preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions\\nof our information technology (\"IT\") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our\\nability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results\\nof operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or\\ncyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in\\nthe demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase\\nsufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In the past we have seen a shortage of parts for\\n23\\nZEQ.=1,SEQ=23,EFW=\"2206674\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=861475,FOLIO=\\'23\\',FILE=\\'DISK123:[11ZDX1.11ZDX75601]DG75601A.;7\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2011;10:42\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nsome\\nof our products. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design\\nwork. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to\\nreengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure\\ncomponents for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could\\nimpact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products\\nhas decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nOur operating results may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when\\ndemand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot\\nincrease our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner and could lead to order cancellations. This inability could materially and\\nadversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity\\nwould adversely affect our income, margins, and operating results.\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate\\nthat revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and\\nmanufacturing facilities are located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n- changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n- trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n- negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\\n- difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing labor regulations;\\n- differing protection of intellectual property;\\n- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n- geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. \\n\\n        We\\ncentralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts\\nreceivables\\n24\\nZEQ.=2,SEQ=24,EFW=\"2206674\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=786042,FOLIO=\\'24\\',FILE=\\'DISK123:[11ZDX1.11ZDX75601]DG75601A.;7\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2011;10:42\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nfunctions.\\nIf conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as\\nwell as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nAdditionally,\\nwe must comply with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting\\ncorrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, restrictions\\non our business conduct and on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our ability to attract and retain employees, our international\\noperations, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that\\nour employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\\nIn\\naddition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and\\nmarketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate\\nmovements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue\\nor increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party\\nfinancial institutions as counterparties. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and our financial condition through, among other\\nthings, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive\\nand administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very\\ndynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our\\npay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to\\nrecruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees, especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts.\\nIf we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition of Varian, Inc., our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition of Varian. The acquisition involves the integration of Varian with the\\nrest of our company. If we cannot successfully integrate Varian\\'s operations, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The\\nintegration of two businesses that have previously operated separately will be a costly and time-consuming process that will involve a number of risks, including, but not limited\\nto:\\n- diversion of senior management\\'s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations; \\n\\n25\\nZEQ.=3,SEQ=25,EFW=\"2206674\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=705575,FOLIO=\\'25\\',FILE=\\'DISK123:[11ZDX1.11ZDX75601]DG75601A.;7\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2011;10:42\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\n- difficulties in the assimilation of different practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as well as in the\\nassimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel;\\n- difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of facilities, departments, systems, including\\naccounting systems, computer and other technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, including internal accounting controls, procedures and policies;\\n- difficulties and uncertainties in achieving anticipated cost reductions and operational synergies; and\\n- the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on integration and implementation activities in excess of our\\ncurrent expectations, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from the Varian acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and\\nretirement of outstanding debt. \\n\\n        Even\\nif we are able to successfully integrate the operations of Varian, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in\\nthe time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited\\nto:\\n- the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected;\\n- the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses, and we may not\\nexperience anticipated growth in that market; and\\n- the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to Varian\\'s products. \\n\\n        As\\na result of these risks, the Varian acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected cost synergies or our return on invested capital targets\\nwhen expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic\\nalliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, during fiscal 2010, we closed our acquisition of Varian, Inc. and the\\nsale of our Network Solutions Division. During fiscal 2011, we completed the acquisitions of A2 Technologies, Lab901 and Biocius Life Sciences Inc. During fiscal 2012, we announced our\\nacquisitions of Accelicon Technologies, BioSystem Development LLC and Halo Genomics AB. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment\\ncommunity\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing\\nadjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions, including the Varian acquisition, and strategic\\nalliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly\\nacquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an\\nacquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:\\n- the retention of key employees; \\n\\n26\\nZEQ.=4,SEQ=26,EFW=\"2206674\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=759282,FOLIO=\\'26\\',FILE=\\'DISK123:[11ZDX1.11ZDX75601]DG75601A.;7\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2011;10:42\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\n- the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n- the retention of key customers;\\n- the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company; and\\n- the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company. \\n\\n        In\\naddition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses\\nis likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial\\nreporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial\\nprocesses and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our\\noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which\\ncould have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nA\\nsuccessful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n- effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n- identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n- reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. \\n\\n        In\\naddition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these\\ncustomers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management\\nresources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market conditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected\\nvalue from such transactions.

These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be\\nrequired to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also\\nresult in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because\\nmany of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.\\nOur\\nproducts and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies\\nsuch as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.

We\\nanalyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming\\ndue to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual\\nproperty infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products,\\nwhich would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services.

An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination\\nby the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various\\njurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require\\nconsiderable estimates and judgments. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax\\nliabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. There can be no\\nassurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A difference in the ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties\\nfrom what is currently estimated could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\\nIf tax incentives change or cease to be in effect, our income taxes could increase significantly.\\nAgilent benefits from tax incentives extended to its foreign subsidiaries to encourage investment or employment. Several jurisdictions\\nhave granted Agilent\\ntax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific types of income.\\nAgilent\\'s taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If Agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may lose the related\\ntax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized. As a result, our effective tax rate could be higher than it would have been had we maintained the benefits of the tax\\nincentives.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States while most of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash\\nsufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nAlthough the cash generated in the United States from our operations covers our normal operating requirements and debt service\\nrequirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such as the satisfaction of our ongoing debt obligations, including our senior notes coming due in September\\n2012, the repurchases of our stock and acquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to\\naddress our U.S. cash requirements through (1) the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or (2) other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $2.1 billion in senior unsecured notes.

Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture\\ngoverning our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the\\ncovenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or\\nman-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters\\nand Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to experience\\na catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since we have consolidated\\nour manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for property damage and\\nbusiness interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance coverage will vary\\nfrom time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets may adversely affect\\nthe cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to\\nself-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.\\nOur results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected if our long-term leasehold counterparty becomes insolvent and the credit\\nsupport on the leasehold transaction fails.\\nIn February 2001, we sold a parcel of surplus land in San Jose, California for $287 million in cash.

We have manufacturing facilities in California, Colorado, North Carolina and Texas in the U.S.\\nOutside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in Germany, Malaysia, Poland, Singapore and U.K. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing.\\n15\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=15,EFW=\"2206674\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=182162,FOLIO=\\'15\\',FILE=\\'DISK123:[11ZDX1.11ZDX75601]DC75601A.;10\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2011;21:21\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nLife Sciences Competition\\nThe markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition.\\nOur principal competitors in the life sciences arena include: Affymetrix Inc., Bruker Corp., Danaher Corporation, Illumina, Inc., Life Technologies Corp., Thermo Fisher\\nScientific Inc. and Waters Corp. Agilent competes on the basis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.\\nLife Sciences Government Regulation\\nThe analysis products and related consumables marketed by our life sciences business are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the EPA\\nunder the Toxic Substances Control Act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the testing,\\nmanufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control\\nAct prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances.\\nTherefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. If\\nwe fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, the EPA can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the\\nfurther distribution or marketing of a product that does not comply or we could face fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories\\nAgilent Technologies Research Laboratories (\"Research Labs\") is our research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with\\noffices in China and Belgium. The Research Labs create competitive advantage through high-impact technology, driving market leadership and growth in Agilent\\'s core businesses and expanding\\nAgilent\\'s measurement footprint into adjacent markets. At the cross-roads of the organization, the Research Labs are able to identify and enable synergies across Agilent\\'s businesses to create\\ncompetitive differentiation and compelling customer value.\\nThe\\ntechnical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific and engineering fields, including biology, chemistry, computer science, distributed measurement,\\nelectrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, nano/microfabrication, microfluidics, software, informatics, optics, physics, physiology and signal processing. As of the end\\nof October 2011, Research Labs employed approximately 210 personnel worldwide.\\nGlobal Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our businesses through our global infrastructure organization. This support includes services in the areas of\\nfinance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. Generally these organizations are centrally operated from Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As\\nof the end of October 2011, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,500 people worldwide.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and\\nDisposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.\\n16\\nZEQ.=7,SEQ=16,EFW=\"2206674\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=852854,FOLIO=\\'16\\',FILE=\\'DISK123:[11ZDX1.11ZDX75601]DC75601A.;10\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2011;21:21\\' \\n THIS IS THE END OF A COMPOSITION COMPONENT \\n \\n COMMAND=ADD_BASECOLOR,\"Black\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_DEFAULTFONT,\"font-family:times;\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_TABLESHADECOLOR,\"#CCEEFF\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_STABLERULES,\"border-bottom:solid #000000 1.0pt;\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_DTABLERULES,\"border-bottom:double #000000 2.25pt;\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_SCRTABLERULES,\"border-bottom:solid #000000 1.0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" \\n COMMAND=ADD_DCRTABLERULES,\"border-bottom:double #000000 2.25pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\" \\n PARA=JUSTIFY\\nTOC_END \\n\\nTable of Contents\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenditures were $649 million in 2011, $612 million in 2010 and $642 million in\\n2009, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of\\ninnovative, high-quality products and services.\\nBacklog\\nOn October 31, 2011, our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately $810 million, as\\ncompared to approximately $830 million at October 31, 2010. On October 31, 2011, our unfilled orders for the chemical analysis business were approximately $320 million, as\\ncompared to approximately $250 million at October 31, 2010. Within our life sciences business, our unfilled orders were approximately $430 million on October 31, 2011 as\\ncompared to approximately $350 million at October 31, 2010. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six\\nmonths. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately three months\\' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term\\nrevenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a\\ncompetitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in\\nitself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials\\nsuch as plastic resins and sheet metal. Our electronic measurement, chemical analysis and life sciences businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the\\nparts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term\\nrelationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their\\nlead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address\\nthe potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative\\ncomponents. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international,\\nfederal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and\\noutside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable\\nenvironmental laws and occupational health and safety laws.

We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The\\nenvironmental, product content/disposal, and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.\\nSome\\nof our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\"). As\\npart of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out\\nof the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and\\nlitigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have\\naccess to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there\\ncan be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation could also harm\\non-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP have been sold.\\nIn\\naddition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us\\nwith respect to such subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect\\nHP\\'s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.\\nWe\\nare liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated\\nto indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at\\nsold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such\\ncontamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe\\nare being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us\\nwhich are not subject to the indemnity.\\nAs\\npart of our acquisition of Varian in 2010, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our\\nobligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.

(\"VAI\") and third-party\\nclaims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially\\nresponsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to\\n18\\nZEQ.=2,SEQ=18,EFW=\"2206674\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=1021817,FOLIO=\\'18\\',FILE=\\'DISK123:[11ZDX1.11ZDX75601]DE75601A.;10\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'15-DEC-2011;21:23\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nwhich\\nVAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental\\ninvestigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is\\nalso handling claims relating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental- related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed\\nto occur within a single fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information\\ncurrently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are unlikely to have\\na material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\\nWe\\nmaintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This\\npolicy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 70 percent in fiscal\\n2011, 68 percent in fiscal 2010, and 67 percent in fiscal 2009, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were\\napproximately 16 percent in fiscal 2011, 14 percent in fiscal 2010 and 13 percent in fiscal 2009. Approximately 11 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2011, 10 percent\\nin fiscal 2010 and 11 percent in fiscal 2009 was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales\\nrepresentative.\\nLong-lived\\nassets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 56 percent in fiscal year 2011,\\n52 percent in fiscal year 2010 and 51 percent in fiscal year 2009. Approximately 13, 13 and 16 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years\\n2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.\\nMost\\nof our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors.\\nHowever, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur\\ninternational business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished\\ngoods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in\\ntax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil,\\nincluding terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in\\ncurrencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an\\nincreased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia.

Risk Factors\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nDepressed general economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. In the past two years, the world\\neconomy has been suffering an economic downturn, including an extreme disruption in worldwide financial markets beginning in 2008. We are unable to predict the strength and duration of an economic\\nrecovery. A continuing,\\nand/or a return to, an economic downturn may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n- reduced demand for our products and increases in order cancellations;\\n- increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n- increased price pressure for our products and services;\\n- reduced access to the credit markets to meet short term cash needs in the U.S.; and\\n- greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of\\norders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to\\n22\\nZEQ.=1,SEQ=22,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=219012,FOLIO=\\'22\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DE18101A.;4\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2010;21:19\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nforecast.\\nIn addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not\\nalways experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\'\\nmarkets or in general economic conditions, including declines related to the current market disruptions described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For\\nexample, we experienced weakness in almost all sectors during 2009 due to declines in market activity caused largely by the continued global economic downturn. The broader semiconductor market is one\\nof the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline,\\nwe may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our\\nability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales,\\nresearch and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins.\\nThe actions that we are taking to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.\\nSince December 2008, we have announced and implemented significant restructuring activities in our global infrastructure organization\\nand our electronic measurement segment. This restructuring program and regular ongoing evaluations of our cost structure, could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and,\\nconsequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our ability to\\nincrease production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases, and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could harm our consolidated financial\\nposition, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service\\nintroductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and\\nenhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will\\ndepend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n- properly identify customer needs;\\n- innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;\\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n- price our products competitively;\\n- anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control product quality in our manufacturing process. \\n\\n23\\nZEQ.=2,SEQ=23,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=749879,FOLIO=\\'23\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DE18101A.;4\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2010;21:19\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nDependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our\\nreputation.

For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which\\nmay preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions\\nof our information technology (\"IT\") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our\\nability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results\\nof operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or\\ncyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in\\nthe demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase\\nsufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. We are already seeing a shortage of parts for some of our products. In addition, some of\\nthe parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease\\nmanufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to\\ncapacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at\\ntimes make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when\\ndemand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to\\nincur additional charges.\\nOur income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when\\ndemand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot\\nincrease our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our\\nresults. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.\\n24\\nZEQ.=3,SEQ=24,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=1033925,FOLIO=\\'24\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DE18101A.;4\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2010;21:19\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate\\nthat revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and\\nmanufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n- changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n- trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n- negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\\n- difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing labor regulations;\\n- differing protection of intellectual property;\\n- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n- geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. \\n\\n        We\\ncentralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts\\nreceivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of\\noperations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nIn\\naddition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and\\nmarketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate\\nmovements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue\\nor increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party\\nfinancial institutions as counterparties. These financial institutions, generally, have experienced and continue to experience significant adverse effects on their business from the current decline in\\ngeneral economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and\\nour financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive\\nand administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business.

We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also intense competition for certain\\nhighly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees, especially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts.\\nThe impact of consolidation of competitors in the electronic measurement and life sciences markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation.\\nFor instance, in February 2010, Danaher Corporation completed its acquisition of the Life Sciences Instrumentation Businesses\\nfrom MDS Inc. and Life Technologies Corp. Consolidation in the electronic measurement and life sciences industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through\\nbusiness combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly\\nconsolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic\\nalliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in fiscal 2009, we completed a number of acquisitions and divestitures. In May\\n2010, we closed our acquisition of Varian, Inc. and the sale of our Network Solutions Division. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment\\ncommunity\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing\\nadjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions, including the Varian acquisition, and strategic\\nalliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly\\nacquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an\\nacquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:\\n- the retention of key employees;\\n- the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n- the retention of key customers;\\n- the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company; and\\n- the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company. \\n\\n        In\\naddition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses\\nis likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial\\nreporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial\\nprocesses and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our\\noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause\\n26\\nZEQ.=5,SEQ=26,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=81941,FOLIO=\\'26\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DE18101A.;4\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2010;21:19\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\ninvestors\\nto lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nA\\nsuccessful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n- effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n- identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n- reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. \\n\\n        In\\naddition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these\\ncustomers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market\\nconditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such\\ntransactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nIf we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our acquisition of Varian, Inc., our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our acquisition of Varian. The acquisition involves the integration of Varian with the\\nrest of our company. If we cannot successfully integrate Varian\\'s operations, we may experience material negative consequences to our business, financial condition or results of operations. The\\nintegration of two businesses that have previously operated separately will be a costly and time-consuming process that will involve a number of risks, including, but not limited\\nto:\\n- diversion of senior management\\'s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\\n- difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as\\nwell as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel;\\n- the potential loss of key personnel who choose not to join the combined business;\\n- the potential loss of key customers who choose not to do business with the combined business;\\n- the risk of higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products;\\n- difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of facilities, departments, systems, including\\naccounting systems, computer and other technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, including internal accounting controls, procedures and policies;\\n- difficulties and uncertainties in achieving anticipated cost reductions and operational synergies; and\\n- the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on integration and implementation activities in excess of our\\ncurrent expectations, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from the Varian acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and\\nretirement of outstanding debt. \\n\\n27\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=27,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=822865,FOLIO=\\'27\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DE18101A.;4\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2010;21:19\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nEven\\nif we are able to successfully integrate the operations of Varian, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in\\nthe time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited\\nto:\\n- the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected;\\n- the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our bio-analytical measurement business, and we may\\nnot experience anticipated growth in that market;\\n- our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the acquisition or\\nliabilities related to the acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\\n- the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to Varian\\'s products; and\\n- the risk that we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements, to the extent\\nthat we incur debt to pay for the acquisition. \\n\\n        As\\na result of these risks, the Varian acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected cost synergies or our return on invested capital targets\\nwhen expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the\\nproperties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nSome of our properties are undergoing remediation by the Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\") for subsurface contaminations that were known\\nat the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of\\nthat contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation\\nactivities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that\\nHP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations.\\nIn addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.\\nWe\\nhave agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us, other than those properties\\ncurrently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination\\nmay exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.\\nOur\\ncurrent and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the\\nenvironment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor\\nrelated businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related\\nto those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to\\nregulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\\n28\\nZEQ.=7,SEQ=28,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=209029,FOLIO=\\'28\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DE18101A.;4\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'14-DEC-2010;21:19\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nAs\\npart of our acquisition of Varian, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our obligation,\\nalong with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.

(\"VAI\") and third-party claims made in\\nconnection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially responsible party\\nunder the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped manufacturing waste for\\nrecycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation\\nactivities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims relating to the CERCLA\\nsites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year, could\\nbe material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the\\nultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our\\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain\\nsatisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to\\nhealth and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be\\nrequired to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also\\nresult in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because\\nmany of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.\\nOur\\nproducts and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies\\nsuch as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules.

The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts\\ncontain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to\\ncomply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.\\nA\\nnumber of our products from our life sciences and chemical analysis businesses are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and certain similar\\nforeign regulatory agencies. In addition, a number of our products may be in the future subject to regulation by the FDA and certain similar foreign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers\\nor distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply, we may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting\\nboth us and our customers, investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the\\nimposition of operating restrictions; increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell\\nour products.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling\\nproducts or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We\\nanalyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming\\ndue to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual\\nproperty infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products,\\nwhich would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our\\nintellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement.

Our competitive position may\\nbe harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a\\ndominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing\\nnon-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for\\ncompetitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual\\nproperty.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. An adverse outcome of any such audit or examination\\nby the IRS or other tax authority could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations of our tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities in various\\njurisdictions. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from ongoing tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. These assessments can require\\nconsiderable estimates and judgments. Intercompany transactions associated with the sale of inventory, services, intellectual property and cost share arrangements are complex and affect our tax\\nliabilities. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. There can be no\\nassurance that the outcomes from ongoing tax examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

Several jurisdictions\\nhave granted Agilent tax incentives which require renewal at various times in the future. The incentives are conditioned on achieving various thresholds of investments and employment, or specific\\ntypes of income. Agilent\\'s taxes could increase if the incentives are not renewed upon expiration. If Agilent cannot or does not wish to satisfy all or parts of the tax incentive conditions, we may\\nlose the related tax incentive and could be required to refund tax incentives previously realized.

We also are a party to a\\nfive-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to $330 million. We may borrow additional amounts in the future and use the proceeds from any\\nfuture borrowing for general corporate purposes, other future acquisitions, expansion of our business or repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock.\\nOur\\nincurrence of this debt, and increases in our aggregate levels of debt, may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other\\nthings:\\n- increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry\\nconditions;\\n- requiring the dedication of an increased portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby\\nreducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and stock repurchases; and\\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry. \\n\\n        Our\\ncurrent revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur\\nindebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, the indenture\\ngoverning our senior notes contains covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If we breach any of the\\ncovenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nOur results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected if our long-term leasehold counterparty becomes insolvent and the credit\\nsupport on the leasehold transaction fails.\\nIn February 2001, we sold a parcel of surplus land in San Jose, California for $287 million in cash.

We have\\nmanufacturing facilities in California, Delaware, and Massachusetts in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we have manufacturing facilities in Australia, China, Italy, Netherlands, Japan and the United\\nKingdom. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing and so typically do not maintain a high level of inventory.\\nChemical Analysis Competition\\nThe markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition.\\nOur principal competitors in the chemical analysis arena include: Bruker Corporation, PerkinElmer Inc., Shimadzu Corporation and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. Agilent competes on the\\nbasis of product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise, global channel coverage and price.\\nChemical Analysis Government Regulation\\nThe analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis business are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern,\\namong other things, the testing, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of\\nchemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA\\ninventory of chemical substances. Therefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other\\nrequirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, the EPA can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of a product that does not comply or\\nwe could face fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.\\nLife Sciences Business\\nOur life sciences business provides application-focused technologies and solutions that include instruments, software, consumables and\\nservices that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and\\nproducts.

This business generated revenue of $1.5 billion in fiscal 2010,\\n$1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008.\\nLife Science Markets\\nOur life sciences business focuses primarily on the following two markets:\\nThe Pharma, Biotech, CRO & CMO Market.\\nThis market consists of \"for-profit\" companies who participate across the\\npharmaceutical\\nvalue chain in the areas of therapeutic research, discovery & development, clinical trials, manufacturing and quality assurance and quality control. One sub-segment of this market\\nis core and emerging pharmaceutical companies, or \"Pharma\". A second sub-segment includes biotechnology companies, or \"biotech\", contract research organizations, or \"CROs\", and contract\\nmanufacturing organizations, or \"CMOs\". Biotech companies and, to a somewhat lesser extent, CROs and CMOs typically participate in specific points in the Pharma industry value chain.\\nThe Academic and Government Market.\\nThis market consists primarily of \"not-for-profit\" organizations and includes academic\\ninstitutions, large government institutes and privately funded organizations. The academic and government research market plays an influential role in technology adoption and therapeutic developments\\nfor Pharma and molecular diagnostics companies. After decades of investment in basic biomedical research by government funding bodies, the focus has widened to include translational\\nresearch — multidisciplinary scientific efforts directed at \"accelerating therapy development\". Notable are\\nefforts by the National Institute of Health, the National Cancer Institute, the European Organisation for Research and the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), the European Molecular Biology Laboratory\\n(EMBL), the Genomics Institute of Singapore (GIS), the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, and the National Translational Cancer Research Network (NTRAC). In addition, large donations by private\\nfoundations are also fueling growth in this key market segment.\\nLife Science Measurement Products and Applications\\nA key factor in all of our life science measurement target markets is the need for new products that increase customer productivity and\\nprovide high quality data that enable decision-making by our customers. Our key product segments include:\\nLiquid Chromatography Products\\nA liquid chromatograph (\"LC\") or a high performance liquid chromatograph (\"HPLC\") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to\\ndetermine the quantity and identity of the molecules present. The Agilent LC portfolio is modular in construction and can be configured as analytical and preparative systems. These systems can be\\nstepwise upgraded to highly sophisticated, automated workflow solutions such as method development, multi-method/walk-up, high-capacity/high-throughput or\\nmulti-dimensional LC and can be extended to application-based analyzers e.g. for bio-molecular separations, chiral analysis or size exclusion chromatograhy. As a leader in liquid\\nchromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns, new services and diagnostics offerings and ongoing instrument and software product enhancements.\\nMass Spectrometry Products\\nA mass spectrometer (\"MS\") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical\\'s molecular mass and characteristic patterns of\\nfragment ion masses that result when a molecule is broken apart. Liquid chromatography (\"LC\") is commonly used to separate compounds and introduce them to the\\n13\\nZEQ.=2,SEQ=13,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=1022079,FOLIO=\\'13\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DC18101A.;5\\',USER=\\'DSCHWAR\\',CD=\\'17-DEC-2010;15:06\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nMS\\nsystem. The combined use of LC and MS (\"LC/MS\") is frequently used both to identify and quantify chemical compounds. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing small molecules and can also\\nbe used to characterize and quantify proteins and other biological entities. Agilent\\'s LC/MS portfolio includes instruments built around five main analyzer types — single\\nquadrupole, triple quadrupole, ion trap, time-of-flight (\"TOF\") and quadrupole time-of-flight (\"QTOF\"). We significantly expanded our mass spectrometry\\nportfolio over the past three years with a focus on improving performance, reliability, and ease of use.\\nMicroarray Products\\nAgilent is a leading provider of microarray-based, genomics research solutions. Our end-to-end solution\\nincludes reagents for sample preparation and microarray processing; hardware for sample QC and high-throughput microarray scanning; 60-mer oligo microarrays on\\nindustry-standard 1\" × 3\" glass slides for gene expression; comparative genomic hybridization (\"CGH\")/Copy Number variation (\"CNV\") analysis, microRNA, methylation, splice variants, and\\nchromatin immunoprecipitation applications; custom microarray design services; and GeneSpring software products for data analysis. We also provide target enrichment products for\\nnext-generation sequencing platforms. In 2010, we released SureSelect™ XT Target Enrichment System, the first fully customizable liquid genome partitioning / enrichment sample\\nprep system that enhances and accelerates nucleic acid sequencing experiment when used in front of \"next generation\" sequencing technologies.\\nPCR Instrumentation\\nThe acquisition of Stratagene Corporation during fiscal 2007 provided an expansion of our life science tools offering with the addition\\nof tools and instrumentation for implementing PCR. PCR is used by scientists studying genetics to amplify or replicate a small amount of DNA to enable further analysis of the genes. Our portfolio of\\nPCR instrumentation, reagents and kits, coupled with our other products such as microarrays and target enrichment systems for next-generation sequencing, provides a broad set of workflow\\nsolutions to customers in the genomics marketplace.\\nBioreagents\\nBioreagents are the primary tools used by scientists in the life science market to interrogate cells, genes and proteins. These\\nbioreagent products are used to conduct a variety of experiments necessary to understand both the form and function of biological entities. The acquisition of Stratagene Corporation provided an\\nexpansion of our Life Science tools offering with the addition of a portfolio of reagent products for Nucleic Acid Amplification (PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR), Cloning,\\nMutagenesis, Cell Biology and other key life science applications. These reagent tools enable us to create a broad set of complete workflow solutions to meet customer needs across our life science\\nmarkets.\\nLab Automation and Robotics\\nThe acquisition of Velocity11 during fiscal 2008 enabled us to offer a more comprehensive suite of workflow solutions to our life\\nscience customers with the addition of automated liquid handling and robotics that range from standalone instrumentation to bench-top automation solutions to large, multi-armed robotic\\nsystems. These solutions strengthened our offering of automated sample- preparation solutions across a broad range of applications. In fiscal 2009 we continued with our focus on automating laboratory\\nprocesses by introducing the new Direct Drive Robot and VWorks Automation Control Software. The Direct Drive Robot advances high-throughput screening for drug-discovery\\nresearch and can also be used in genomics applications, including DNA extraction and PCR sample preparation.\\n14\\nZEQ.=3,SEQ=14,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=731852,FOLIO=\\'14\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DC18101A.;5\\',USER=\\'DSCHWAR\\',CD=\\'17-DEC-2010;15:06\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nElectrophoresis Products\\nElectrophoresis is used in many scientific and applied disciplines, such as food identification or protein quality control, to\\nseparate, quantify, enrich and purify biomolecules which differ in their electrical charge or polarity.

This support includes services in the areas of\\nfinance, legal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. These organizations are generally headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the\\nend of October 2010, our global infrastructure organization employed approximately 2,200 people worldwide, which includes the Agilent Labs researchers described above.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and\\nDisposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenditures were $612 million in 2010, $642 million in 2009 and $704 million in\\n2008, the vast majority of which was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of\\ninnovative, high-quality products and services.\\nBacklog\\nOn October 31, 2010, our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business were approximately $830 million, as\\ncompared to approximately $670 million at October 31, 2009. On October 31, 2010, our unfilled orders for the chemical analysis business were approximately $250 million, as\\ncompared to approximately $160 million at October 31, 2009. Within our life sciences business, our unfilled orders were approximately $350 million on October 31, 2010 as\\ncompared to approximately $210 million at October 31, 2009. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for all three businesses will be delivered to customers within six\\nmonths. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately three months\\' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term\\nrevenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a\\ncompetitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in\\nitself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\n17\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=17,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=1011217,FOLIO=\\'17\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DC18101A.;5\\',USER=\\'DSCHWAR\\',CD=\\'17-DEC-2010;15:06\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials\\nsuch as plastic resins and sheet metal. Our electronic measurement, chemical analysis and life sciences businesses all purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the\\nparts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term\\nrelationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their\\nlead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address\\nthe potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we\\ngenerally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international,\\nfederal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and\\noutside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable\\nenvironmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of\\nenvironmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws\\nregarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal, and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur\\nsignificant expenditures in the future.\\nSome\\nof our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\"). As\\npart of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out\\nof the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and\\nlitigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have\\naccess to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there\\ncan be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation could also harm\\non-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP have been sold.\\nIn\\naddition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us\\nwith respect to such subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental\\nagencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect HP\\'s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.\\n18\\nZEQ.=7,SEQ=18,EFW=\"2201423\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=574758,FOLIO=\\'18\\',FILE=\\'DISK131:[10ZCV1.10ZCV18101]DC18101A.;5\\',USER=\\'DSCHWAR\\',CD=\\'17-DEC-2010;15:06\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nWe\\nare liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated\\nto indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at\\nsold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such\\ncontamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe\\nare being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us\\nwhich are not subject to the indemnity.\\nAs\\npart of our acquisition of Varian in 2010, we assumed the liabilities of Varian, including Varian\\'s costs and potential liabilities for environmental matters. One such cost is our\\nobligation, along with the obligation of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (\"VSEA\") (under the terms of a Distribution Agreement between Varian, VSEA and Varian Medical\\nSystems, Inc. (\"VMS\")) to each indemnify VMS for one-third of certain costs (after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by VMS for such\\ncosts) relating to (a) environmental investigation, monitoring and/or remediation activities at certain facilities previously operated by Varian Associates, Inc. (\"VAI\") and third-party\\nclaims made in connection with environmental conditions at those facilities, and (b) U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or third-party claims alleging that VAI or VMS is a potentially\\nresponsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (\"CERCLA\") in connection with certain sites to which VAI allegedly shipped\\nmanufacturing waste for recycling, treatment or disposal (the \"CERCLA sites\"). With respect to the facilities formerly operated by VAI, VMS is overseeing the environmental investigation, monitoring\\nand/or remediation activities, in most cases under the direction of, or in consultation with, federal, state and/or local agencies, and handling third-party claims. VMS is also handling claims\\nrelating to the CERCLA sites. Although any ultimate liability arising from environmental-related matters could result in significant expenditures that, if aggregated and assumed to occur within a\\nsingle fiscal year, could be material to our financial statements, the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote. Based on information currently available and our best assessment of the\\nultimate amount and timing of environmental-related events, management believes that the costs of environmental-related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our\\nfinancial condition or results of operations.\\nWe\\nmaintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This\\npolicy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 68 percent in fiscal\\n2010, 67 percent in fiscal 2009, and 68 percent in fiscal 2008, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were\\napproximately 14 percent in fiscal 2010, 13 percent in fiscal 2009 and 11 percent in fiscal 2008.

In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors.\\nHowever, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur\\ninternational business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished\\ngoods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in\\ntax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil,\\nincluding terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in\\ncurrencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk\\nof political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations\\nsuch as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single\\ncountry. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 21, \"Segment Information\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition and Disposal of Material Assets\\nOn May 14, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Varian, Inc., a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and\\nassociated consumables for life science and applied market applications, for a total cash purchase price of approximately $1.5 billion. Varian\\'s products include analytical instruments,\\nresearch products and related software, consumable products, accessories and services, as well as vacuum products and related services and accessories. The acquisition broadens Agilent\\'s applications\\nand solutions offerings in life sciences, environmental, and energy and materials.

Risk Factors\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nContinued depressed general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Worldwide financial markets have\\nexperienced extreme disruption in the past year, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades and\\ndeclining valuations of investments. These disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. We are unable to predict how long the economic downturn will last. A\\ncontinuing economic downturn and continuing financial market disruptions may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n- reduced demand for our products realized by diminished new orders and increases in order cancellations;\\n- increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n- increased pressure on the prices for our products and services;\\n- greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\\n- reduced access to the credit markets to meet short term cash needs in the U.S.; and\\n- greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.Our operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of\\norders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or\\ncyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic\\nconditions, including declines related to the current market disruptions described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, we experienced\\nweakness in almost all sectors during the year due to declines in market activity caused largely by the continued global economic downturn. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for\\nour electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able\\nto collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain\\nprofitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and\\ndevelopment and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins.\\nThe actions that we are taking to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.\\nSince December 2008, we have announced and implemented significant restructuring activities in our global infrastructure organization\\nand our semiconductor and board test segment and electronic measurement segment. This restructuring program and regular ongoing evaluations of our cost\\n22\\nZEQ.=1,SEQ=22,EFW=\"2195875\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=1033634,FOLIO=\\'22\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[09ZDM1.09ZDM16501]DE16501A.;11\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'18-DEC-2009;20:46\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nstructure,\\ncould have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and, consequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements\\nin our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases, and limiting our ability to hire\\nand retain key personnel. These circumstances could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service\\nintroductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and\\nenhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will\\ndepend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n- properly identify customer needs;\\n- innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;\\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n- price our products competitively;\\n- anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control product quality in our manufacturing process.Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our\\nreputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and\\nother functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality\\nlevels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which\\nmay preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions\\nof our information technology (\"IT\") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our\\nability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results\\nof operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\n23\\nZEQ.=2,SEQ=23,EFW=\"2195875\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=935584,FOLIO=\\'23\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[09ZDM1.09ZDM16501]DE16501A.;11\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'18-DEC-2009;20:46\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or\\ncyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in\\nthe demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase\\nsufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from\\nalternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In\\naddition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production\\nof products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our\\ninventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our\\nproducts is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nOur income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when\\ndemand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot\\nincrease our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our\\nresults. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate\\nthat revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and\\nmanufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n- changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n- trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n- negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\\n- difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing labor regulations; \\n\\n24\\nZEQ.=3,SEQ=24,EFW=\"2195875\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=306589,FOLIO=\\'24\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[09ZDM1.09ZDM16501]DE16501A.;11\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'18-DEC-2009;20:46\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\n- differing protection of intellectual property;\\n- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n- geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. \\n\\n        We\\ncentralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts\\nreceivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of\\noperations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nIn\\naddition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and\\nmarketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate\\nmovements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue\\nor increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party\\nfinancial institutions as counterparties. These financial institutions, generally, have experienced and continue to experience significant adverse effects on their business from the current decline in\\ngeneral economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and\\nour financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of the counterparties to perform under hedging contracts.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive\\nand administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very\\ndynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate.\\nHowever, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees,\\nespecially in light of our ongoing restructuring efforts.\\nThe impact of consolidation of competitors in the electronic measurement and life sciences markets is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe electronic measurement and life sciences industries are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation.\\nFor instance, in September 2009, Danaher Corporation announced an agreement to acquire the Life Sciences Instrumentation Businesses from MDS Inc. and Life Technologies Corp. Consolidation in\\nthe electronic measurement and life sciences industries could result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on\\nour business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry\\nconsolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\n25\\nZEQ.=4,SEQ=25,EFW=\"2195875\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=440637,FOLIO=\\'25\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[09ZDM1.09ZDM16501]DE16501A.;11\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'18-DEC-2009;20:46\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic\\nalliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in fiscal 2009, we completed a number of acquisitions and divestitures. In\\naddition, in July 2009, we agreed to acquire Varian, Inc. The closing of the Varian acquisition is subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of antitrust\\napprovals in both the U.S. and the European Union. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter,\\nor over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or\\nindemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions, including the Varian acquisition, and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a\\ndifferent company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances\\nthe performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the\\nentity depends on a variety of factors, including:\\n- the retention of key employees;\\n- the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n- the retention of key customers;\\n- the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities with those of the acquired company; and\\n- the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company. \\n\\n        In\\naddition, effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. The integration of acquired businesses\\nis likely to result in our systems and controls becoming increasingly complex and more difficult to manage. We devote significant resources and time to comply with the internal control over financial\\nreporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. However, we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate control over our financial\\nprocesses and reporting in the future, especially in the context of acquisitions of other businesses. Any difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our\\noperating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which\\ncould have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock and our access to capital.\\nA\\nsuccessful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n- effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n- identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n- reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. \\n\\n        In\\naddition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these\\ncustomers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market\\nconditions or other\\n26\\nZEQ.=5,SEQ=26,EFW=\"2195875\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=476986,FOLIO=\\'26\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[09ZDM1.09ZDM16501]DE16501A.;11\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'18-DEC-2009;20:46\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nfactors\\nlead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions, our\\nconsolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nIf we do not achieve the contemplated benefits of our pending acquisition of Varian, Inc., our business and financial condition may be materially impaired.\\nWe may not achieve the desired benefits from our pending acquisition of Varian. In addition, the consummation of the Varian acquisition\\nis subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the receipt of antitrust approvals in both the U.S. and the European Union. While we intend to consummate the Varian\\nacquisition as soon as practicable after such approvals are obtained, there can be no assurance that we will obtain such approvals or satisfy the other conditions to consummation of the Varian\\nacquisition when expected or at all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing the acquisition or restrict our ability to realize the expected financial and strategic goals\\nof the transaction.\\nThe\\nacquisition involves the integration of Varian with the rest of our company. If we cannot successfully integrate Varian\\'s operations, we may experience material negative consequences\\nto our business, financial condition or results of operations. The integration of two businesses that have previously operated separately will be a costly and time-consuming process that\\nwill involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\\n- diversion of senior management\\'s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\\n- difficulties in the assimilation of different corporate cultures, practices and sales and distribution methodologies, as\\nwell as in the assimilation and retention of geographically dispersed, decentralized operations and personnel;\\n- the potential loss of key personnel who choose not to join the combined business;\\n- the potential loss of key customers who choose not to do business with the combined business;\\n- the risk of higher than anticipated costs in continuing support and development of acquired products;\\n- difficulties and unanticipated expenses related to the integration of facilities, departments, systems, including\\naccounting systems, computer and other technologies, books and records and procedures, as well as in maintaining uniform standards, including internal accounting controls, procedures and policies;\\n- difficulties and uncertainties in achieving anticipated cost reductions and operational synergies; and\\n- the use of cash resources and increased capital expenditures on integration and implementation activities in excess of our\\ncurrent expectations, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from the Varian acquisition and limit other potential uses of our cash, including stock repurchases and\\nretirement of outstanding debt. \\n\\n        Even\\nif we are able to successfully integrate the operations of Varian, we may not be able to realize the cost savings, synergies and growth that we anticipate from the acquisition in\\nthe time frame that we currently expect, and the costs of achieving these benefits may be higher than what we currently expect, because of a number of risks, including, but not limited\\nto:\\n- the possibility that the acquisition may not further our business strategy as we expected; \\n\\n27\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=27,EFW=\"2195875\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=1005805,FOLIO=\\'27\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[09ZDM1.09ZDM16501]DE16501A.;11\\',USER=\\'JJORGE\\',CD=\\'18-DEC-2009;20:46\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\n- the fact that the acquisition will substantially expand our bio-analytical measurement business, and we may\\nnot experience anticipated growth in that market;\\n- our operating results or financial condition may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume in the acquisition or\\nliabilities related to the acquisition, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\\n- the risk of intellectual property disputes with respect to Varian\\'s products; and\\n- the risk that we may significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements, to the extent\\nthat we incur debt to pay for the acquisition. \\n\\n        As\\na result of these risks, the Varian acquisition may not contribute to our earnings as expected, we may not achieve expected cost synergies or our return on invested capital targets\\nwhen expected, or at all, and we may not achieve the other anticipated strategic and financial benefits of this transaction.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the\\nproperties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nSome of our properties are undergoing remediation by the Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\") for subsurface contaminations that were known\\nat the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of\\nthat contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation\\nactivities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that\\nHP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations.\\nIn addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.\\nWe\\nhave agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us, other than those properties\\ncurrently undergoing remediation by HP.

These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be\\nrequired to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also\\nresult in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because\\nmany of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.\\nOur\\nproducts and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies\\nsuch as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission.

The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts\\ncontain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to\\ncomply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.\\nA\\nnumber of our products from our bio-analytical measurement business are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and certain similar\\nforeign regulatory agencies.

We\\nanalyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming\\ndue to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual\\nproperty infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, could require us to redesign our products,\\nwhich would be costly and time-consuming, and/or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our\\nintellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement.

Our competitive position may\\nbe harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement because an infringer has a\\ndominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing\\nnon-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for\\ncompetitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues.

The recent disruptions in the financial\\nmarkets have, in some cases, resulted in an inability to access assets such as money market funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial\\ninstitutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash equivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition. As of October 31, 2009, we also\\nhad $1.6 billion of restricted cash which is invested in a portfolio of highly rated, short term commercial paper. This restricted cash is invested in a diverse portfolio of commercial paper\\nrated A-1+/P-1 with maturities of less than 100 days, in each case, at the time of purchase; however, a failure of the issuer of any such commercial paper may result in\\nan adverse impact on the portfolio.\\nWe have outstanding debt and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nWe currently have outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $1,350 million in senior unsecured notes.

In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters\\nand Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities\\nwere to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since we\\nhave consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for\\nproperty damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance\\ncoverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets\\nmay adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, or to the extent we have elected to\\nself-insure, we may be at a greater risk that our operations will be harmed by a catastrophic loss.',\n",

On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately two months\\' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any\\nparticular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a\\ncompetitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in\\nitself material. In addition, our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials\\nsuch as plastic resins and sheet metal. Our electronic measurement, bio-analytical measurement and semiconductor and board test businesses all purchase materials from thousands of\\nsuppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design\\nwork. Our long-term relationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some\\nsuppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a\\n17\\nZEQ.=8,SEQ=17,EFW=\"2195875\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=327824,FOLIO=\\'17\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[09ZDM1.09ZDM16501]DC16501A.;12\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2009;11:26\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nsubstitute\\nquickly or at all. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply and redesign of products for\\nalternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international,\\nfederal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and\\noutside the U.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable\\nenvironmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of\\nenvironmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state, and local laws\\nregarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal, and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur\\nsignificant expenditures in the future.\\nSome\\nof our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company\\n(\"HP\"). As part of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims\\narising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of remediation of additional contamination caused by us, if any, could involve costly and time-consuming\\nnegotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with\\nHP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the\\nremediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. The remediation\\ncould also harm on-site operations and the future use and negatively affect the value and future use of the properties. Several of the sites under the initial separation agreement from HP\\nhave been sold.\\nIn\\naddition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us\\nwith respect to such subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect\\nHP\\'s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.\\nWe\\nare liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are obligated\\nto indemnify HP for liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations, if any, at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at\\nsold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such\\ncontamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\n18\\nZEQ.=9,SEQ=18,EFW=\"2195875\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\",DN=\"1\",CHK=202212,FOLIO=\\'18\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[09ZDM1.09ZDM16501]DC16501A.;12\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2009;11:26\\' \\n \\nTable of Contents\\nWe\\nare being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities assumed by us\\nwhich are not subject to the indemnity.\\nWe\\nmaintain a comprehensive Environmental Site Liability insurance policy which may cover certain clean-up costs or legal claims related to environmental contamination. This\\npolicy covers specified active, inactive and divested locations.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 67 percent in fiscal\\n2009, 68 percent in fiscal 2008 and 66 percent in fiscal 2007, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Annual revenues derived from China were\\napproximately 13 percent in fiscal 2009, 11 percent in fiscal 2008 and 10 percent in fiscal 2007. Approximately 11 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2009 and\\n12 percent in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales\\nrepresentative.\\nLong-lived\\nassets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 51 percent in fiscal year 2009,\\n48 percent in fiscal year 2008 and 55 percent in fiscal year 2007. Approximately 16, 14 and 16 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years\\n2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively.\\nMost\\nof our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors.\\nHowever, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur\\ninternational business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished\\ngoods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in\\ntax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil,\\nincluding terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in\\ncurrencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk\\nof political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide\\noperations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 21, \"Segment\\nInformation\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition and Disposal of Material Assets\\nOn July 26, 2009, Agilent, Varian, Inc. (\"Varian\"), and Cobalt Acquisition Corp., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of\\nAgilent, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Varian would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent.

On June 1, 2006, Agilent transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its\\nsemiconductor test solutions business to a separate company, Verigy Ltd. (\"Verigy\"), then a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent. In June and July 2006, Verigy sold approximately\\n8.7 million of its ordinary shares, or approximately 15 percent of its outstanding shares, in an initial public offering. On October 31, 2006, we distributed our remaining holding\\nin Verigy to our stockholders.\\nWe\\nhave reflected the semiconductor products business and the semiconductor test solutions business as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on\\nForm 10-K. For further information, see Note 4, \"Discontinued Operations of Our Semiconductor Products Business\" and Note 5, \"Discontinued Operations of Our\\nSemiconductor Test Solutions Business\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nElectronic Measurement Business\\nOur electronic measurement business provides standard and customized electronic measurement instruments and systems monitoring,\\nmanagement and optimization tools for communications networks and services, software design tools and related services that are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment\\nand operation of electronics equipment and communications networks and services.

On October 31, 2008, our unfilled orders for the bio-analytical measurement business were approximately\\n$370 million, as compared to approximately $290 million at October 31, 2007. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for both businesses will be delivered to\\ncustomers within nine months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately two months\\' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of\\nshort-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a\\ncompetitive advantage. While we\\nbelieve that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition, our\\nintellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials\\nsuch as plastic resins and sheet metal. Both our electronic and bio-analytical measurement businesses purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. Some of the parts\\nthat require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships\\nwith suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit\\nsupplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address the potential\\ndisruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we generally attempt\\nto keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international,\\nfederal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health and safety to sites inside and outside the\\nU.S., even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental\\nlaws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health\\nand safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product\\npackaging and product content requirements. These laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures.\\nSome\\nof our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\"). As\\npart of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP has agreed to retain the\\n16\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=16,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=161573,FOLIO=\\'16\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DC40001A.;6\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:13\\'\\nliability\\nfor the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of any\\nadditional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations\\nin this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference\\nwith on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required\\nto incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. Remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties.\\nIn\\naddition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us\\nwith respect to that subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect\\nHP\\'s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.\\nWe\\nare liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are\\nindemnifying HP for any liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or\\ndiscontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination\\nor regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe\\nare being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities being assumed\\nby us which are not subject to the indemnity.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 68 percent in fiscal\\n2008, 66 percent in fiscal 2007 and 66 percent in fiscal 2006, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Approximately 12 percent of our annual\\nrevenue in each of the last three years was derived from Japan. Approximately 11 percent of our revenue in fiscal 2008, 10 percent in fiscal 2007 and 8 percent in fiscal 2006 was\\nderived from China. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.\\nLong-lived\\nassets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 48 percent in fiscal 2008,\\n55 percent in fiscal year 2007 and 55 percent in fiscal year 2006. Approximately 14, 16 and 19 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years\\n2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.\\nMost\\nof our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors.\\nHowever, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur\\ninternational business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished\\ngoods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade\\n17\\nZEQ.=7,SEQ=17,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=426584,FOLIO=\\'17\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DC40001A.;6\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:13\\'\\nprotection\\nmeasures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing\\nlabor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales\\ncommitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent\\nin any debt we incur, or investment and finance receivable portfolios we hold. There may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as\\nSoutheast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic changes in any single\\ncountry. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 21, \"Segment Information\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition and Disposal of Material Assets\\nOn November 28, 2005, we completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. (\"Lumileds\") to Philips\\npursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the \"Share Purchase Agreement\") dated as of August 12, 2005 among Agilent, Agilent LED International, Philips Lumileds Holding B.V. and Philips.\\nUnder the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, Agilent received $949 million in cash proceeds, as well as approximately $51 million in repayment of outstanding advances to Lumileds and\\ninterest due to Agilent.\\nIn\\nDecember 2005, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of our semiconductor products business to Avago pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of\\nAugust 14, 2005 and amended November 30, 2005 (the \"Asset Purchase Agreement\"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Agilent received approximately $2.6 billion in\\ncash proceeds.\\nOn\\nOctober 31, 2006, we distributed Agilent\\'s equity interest in Verigy by means of a dividend to our stockholders. Prior to the distribution, on June 1, 2006, Agilent\\ntransferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its semiconductor test solutions business to Verigy, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent. In June and July 2006, Verigy sold\\napproximately 8.7 million of its ordinary shares, or approximately 15 percent of its outstanding shares, in an initial public offering. On October 31, 2006, the aggregate market\\nvalue of the Verigy shares which were distributed was $840 million.\\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nDavid S.

Risk Factors\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nDeclining general economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\\nOur business is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, both inside and outside the U.S. Worldwide financial markets have\\nexperienced extreme disruption in recent months, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades and\\ndeclining valuations of investments. These disruptions are likely to have an ongoing adverse effect on the world economy. We are unable to predict how long the economic downturn will last. A\\ncontinuing economic downturn and financial market disruptions may adversely impact our business resulting in:\\n- Reduced demand for our products realized by diminished new orders and increases in order cancellations;\\n- Increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories;\\n- Increased pressure on the prices for our products and services;\\n- Greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\\n- Reduced access to the credit markets to meet short term cash needs in the U.S.; and\\n- Greater risk of impairment to the value, and a detriment to the liquidity, of our investment portfolio.\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of\\norders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or\\ncyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic\\nconditions, including declines related to the current market disruptions described above, would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. The broader semiconductor market\\nis one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers\\' markets\\ndecline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such decline could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit\\nour ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales,\\nresearch and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross margins.\\nThe actions that we have taken in order to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.\\nWe have completed our program to transition our company to a reduced cost structure. These reductions and regular ongoing evaluations\\nof our cost structure, could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and, consequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing\\nimprovements in our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases\\n21\\nZEQ.=1,SEQ=21,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=203076,FOLIO=\\'21\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001A.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\nand\\nlimiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our income to be lower than it otherwise might be and, as a result, adversely affect our stock price.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service\\nintroductions and changing industry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and\\nenhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will\\ndepend on several factors, including our ability to:\\n- properly identify customer needs;\\n- innovate and develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;\\n- differentiate our offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n- price our products competitively;\\n- anticipate our competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control product quality in our manufacturing process.Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our\\nreputation. Dependence on outsourced information technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and\\nother functions and will continue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality\\nlevels, our ability to bring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which\\nmay preclude us from fulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions\\nof our information technology (\"IT\") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our\\nability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results\\nof operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or\\ncyclical nature of the markets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in\\nthe demand for their products. For example, the consumer\\n22\\nZEQ.=2,SEQ=22,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=963586,FOLIO=\\'22\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001A.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\nelectronics\\nmarket is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product\\ndemand, which could materially affect our results. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length\\nof time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend\\nlead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into\\nnon-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior\\ncommitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may\\nexperience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nOur income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when\\ndemand does not meet our expectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot\\nincrease our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our\\nresults. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate\\nthat revenue from international operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and\\nmanufacturing facilities are increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n- changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n- changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n- trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n- negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\\n- difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing labor regulations;\\n- differing protection of intellectual property;\\n- unexpected changes in regulatory requirements; and\\n- geopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war. \\n\\n23\\nZEQ.=3,SEQ=23,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=21508,FOLIO=\\'23\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001A.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        We\\ncentralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia.

Our results of\\noperations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nIn\\naddition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for in U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and\\nmarketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not always entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate\\nmovements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency controls, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue\\nor increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging strategy does not mitigate our exposure. In addition, our currency hedging programs involve third party\\nfinancial institutions as counterparties. These financial institutions, generally, have experienced and continue to experience significant adverse effects on their business from the current decline in\\ngeneral economic conditions and uncertainties in the global credit and equity markets. The weakening or failure of financial institution counterparties may adversely affect our hedging programs and\\nour financial condition through, among other things, a reduction in available counterparties, increasingly unfavorable terms, and the failure of performance under hedging contracts.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive\\nand administrative personnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very\\ndynamic, and our businesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate.\\nHowever, there is also intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees.\\nThe impact of consolidation of competitors in the test and measurement market is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe test and measurement industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. For instance, in\\nNovember 2007, Danaher Corporation, one of our competitors, completed the acquisition of Tektronix, Inc., another of our competitors. Consolidation in the test and measurement industry\\ncould result in existing competitors increasing their market share through business combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\\noperations. We may not be able to compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic\\nalliances, joint ventures and divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, last year we completed a number of acquisitions, including the acquisition of\\nVelocity11 in our first fiscal quarter. As a result of such transactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal\\n24\\nZEQ.=4,SEQ=24,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=1018760,FOLIO=\\'24\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001A.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\nquarter,\\nor over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or\\nindemnifications, the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team\\nand business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses\\nor product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors,\\nincluding:\\n- the retention of key employees;\\n- the management of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n- the retention of key customers;\\n- the compatibility of our sales programs and facilities within those of the acquired company; and\\n- the compatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company. \\n\\n        A\\nsuccessful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n- effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n- identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n- reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. \\n\\n        Future\\nimpairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. And, our inability to timely and effectively\\napply our systems of internal controls to an acquired business could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\nIn\\naddition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these\\ncustomers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market\\nconditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such\\ntransactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the\\nproperties involved and environmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nSome of our properties are undergoing remediation by the Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\") for subsurface contaminations that were known\\nat the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of\\nthat contamination. HP will have access to our properties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation\\nactivities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that\\nHP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation obligations. In\\n25\\nZEQ.=5,SEQ=25,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=980275,FOLIO=\\'25\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001B.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\naddition,\\nthe determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation.\\nWe\\nhave agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us other than those properties\\ncurrently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination\\nmay exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.\\nOur\\ncurrent and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the\\nenvironment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor\\nrelated businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related\\nto those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to\\nregulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain\\nsatisfactory compliance with certain regulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to\\nhealth and safety, packaging, product content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be\\nrequired to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also\\nresult in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In addition, because\\nmany of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.\\nOur\\nproducts and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies\\nsuch as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nSome\\nof our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the\\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform\\nthe manufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to\\ncomply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from\\ndistributing our products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\n26\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=26,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=961102,FOLIO=\\'26\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001B.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\n\\n We are subject to laws and regulations, and failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue\\nassociated with these customers.\\nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and\\nregulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts\\ncontain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to\\ncomply with these regulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.\\nA\\nnumber of our products from our bio-analytical measurement business are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and certain similar\\nforeign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply,\\nwe may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers, investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; partial\\nsuspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions, increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our\\nproducts or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling\\nproducts or services.\\nFrom time to time, third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights. We\\nanalyze and take action in response to such claims on a case by case basis. Any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming\\ndue to the complexity of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual\\nproperty infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, or could subject us to significant damages\\nor to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services. Our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim, or negotiating a license, in\\nresponse to a claim of intellectual property infringement. In certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available\\nto us in the future on favorable terms or at all.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents,\\ncopyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights\\nsuccessfully our competitive position may suffer which could harm our operating results.\\nOur\\npending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents,\\ncopyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.\\n27\\nZEQ.=7,SEQ=27,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=962217,FOLIO=\\'27\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001B.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\n        We\\nmay need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may\\nbe harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a\\ndominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing\\nnon-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for\\ncompetitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allow them to compete with us using that intellectual\\nproperty.\\nWe have received a Revenue Agent\\'s Report from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 claiming a significant increase in our\\nU.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome of this examination or any future examinations involving similar claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial\\ncondition and liquidity.\\nOur U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002 have been under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). In\\nAugust 2007, we received a Revenue Agent\\'s Report (\"RAR\"). In the RAR, the IRS proposes to assess a net tax deficiency, after applying available net operating losses from the years under audit\\nand undisputed tax credits, for those years of approximately $405 million, plus penalties of approximately $160 million and interest. If the IRS were to fully prevail, our net operating\\nloss and tax credits generated in recent years would be utilized earlier than they otherwise would have been and our annual effective tax rate will have increased as a result. The RAR addresses\\nseveral issues. One issue, however, relating to the use of Agilent\\'s brand name by our foreign affiliates, accounts for a majority of the claimed tax deficiency. We believe that the claimed IRS\\nadjustment for this issue in particular is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious defenses to this claim. Therefore, we have not included any tax for this item in our tax\\nprovision for 2007 or 2008. We have filed a formal protest and will address these matters with the Appeals Office. In the protest, we opposed the claim associated with Agilent\\'s brand name, and most\\nof the other claimed adjustments proposed in the RAR, vigorously. In April of 2008, we received a rebuttal to our formal protest. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and may\\ntake several years. Based on current information, it is our opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position,\\nresults of operations or liquidity. However, if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is in excess of the tax provisions we have recorded in connection with the proposed assessment, our results of\\noperations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\\nAdverse conditions in the global banking industry and credit markets may adversely impact the value of our cash investments or impair our liquidity.\\nAt the end of fiscal 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.4 billion invested or held in a mix of money\\nmarket funds, time deposit accounts and bank demand deposit accounts. The recent disruptions in the financial markets have, in some cases, resulted in an inability to access assets such as money\\nmarket funds that traditionally have been viewed as highly liquid. Any failure of our counterparty financial institutions or funds in which we have invested may adversely impact our cash and cash\\nequivalent positions and, in turn, our results and financial condition. As of October 31, 2008, we also had $1.6 billion of restricted cash which is invested in a portfolio of highly\\nrated, short term commercial paper. This restricted cash is invested in a diverse portfolio of commercial paper rated A-1+/P-1 with maturities of less than 100 days, in\\neach case, at the time of purchase; however, a failure of the issuer of any such commercial paper may result in an adverse impact on the portfolio.\\n28\\nZEQ.=8,SEQ=28,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=166846,FOLIO=\\'28\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001B.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\n        In\\nDecember 2007, the company reclassified a $255 million investment from cash equivalents to short-term investments. In February 2008, Agilent traded\\nthis externally managed short-term investment fund for the underlying securities of the investment and now manages a portfolio of those investments internally. This portfolio consists of a\\nvariety of fixed income securities, including some mortgage-backed securities. In prior distributions, we experienced losses with respect to this portfolio. There can be no assurance that we will not\\nrealize additional net losses and/or experience further mark-to-market losses in stockholders equity with respect to these investments which could have a material adverse\\nimpact to our results and financial condition.\\nWe have issued $600 million in a debt offering and entered into a credit facility and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial\\ncondition, liquidity and results of operations.\\nIn October 2007, we issued $600 million in senior unsecured notes. In addition, in May 2007, we entered into a\\nfive-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to $300 million. We may borrow in the future and use the proceeds from any future borrowing for\\ngeneral corporate purposes, future acquisitions, repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock or expansion of our business. We may enter into an additional financing arrangement in order to\\nsatisfy our $1.5 billion repurchase obligation of our subsidiary, Agilent Technologies World Trade, which is scheduled to come due in January 2011.\\nOur\\nincurrence of this debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n- increasing our vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry\\nconditions;\\n- requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing\\nthe amount of expected cash\\nflow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and\\n- limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry. \\n\\n        Our\\ncurrent revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur\\nindebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our\\nlong-term non-convertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If\\nwe breach any of the covenants under our long-term debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our\\noutstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nOur results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected if our long-term leasehold counterparty becomes insolvent and the credit\\nsupport on the leasehold transaction fails.\\nIn February 2001, we sold a parcel of surplus land in San Jose, California for $287 million in cash. In\\nAugust 2001, we completed a like-kind exchange by acquiring a long-term leasehold interest in several municipal properties in southern California for a total value of\\n$289 million. In 2002, we received $237 million in non-refundable prepaid rent related to the leasehold interests described above. We contracted with a third party to provide\\ncredit protection for certain aspects of the transaction, including a future bankruptcy of the municipality. The current third party insurer is a subsidiary of American International Group Inc.\\n(\"AIG\") which has recently experienced a credit\\n29\\nZEQ.=9,SEQ=29,EFW=\"2189713\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=614628,FOLIO=\\'29\\',FILE=\\'DISK107:[08ZDT1.08ZDT40001]DE40001B.;5\\',USER=\\'BKYNARD\\',CD=\\'19-DEC-2008;14:29\\' \\n \\nrating\\ndowngrade by Moody\\'s and Standard & Poor\\'s and has been the recipient of U.S federal government sponsored loans. If the municipality was to become insolvent and the credit support on the\\ntransaction was to fail, our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States while a majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash\\nsufficient to address our cash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nAlthough cash generated in the United States covers normal operating requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required\\nfor special purposes such as repurchases of our stock and acquisitions of third parties. Our business operating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if\\nwe were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through (1) the efficient and timely repatriations of overseas cash or (2) other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable\\ncost.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or\\nman-made disasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters\\nand Agilent Technologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities\\nwere to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since we\\nhave consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for\\nproperty damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism. Also, our third party insurance\\ncoverage will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on availability, cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention. Economic conditions and uncertainties in global markets\\nmay adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain third party insurance. If our third party insurance coverage is adversely affected, we may be at a greater risk that our\\noperations be harmed by a catastrophic loss.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Item 1A.    Risk Factors\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the\\nfiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future fiscal quarters are often based on the expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets.\\nHowever, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a\\nreduction in demand for our products and services. For example, if the Asia Pacific market does not grow as anticipated, our results could suffer. We experienced recent weakness in our Asia Pacific\\nmarket, notably in Japan and particularly during the six months ended October 31, 2007. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and\\ntherefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement business. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to\\nus. Such decline could harm our consolidated financial position, results of\\noperations, cash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our\\noperating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further\\nreduce our gross margins.\\nThe actions that we have taken in order to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.\\nWe have largely completed our program to transition our company to a reduced cost structure. These reductions and regular ongoing evaluations of our cost\\nstructure, could have the effect of reducing our talent pool and available resources and, consequently, could have long-term effects on our business by decreasing or slowing improvements\\nin our products, affecting our ability to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire\\nand retain key personnel. These circumstances could cause our income to be lower than it otherwise might be and, as a result, adversely affect our stock price.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing\\nindustry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and\\nservices will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors,\\nincluding our ability to:\\n- properly\\nidentify customer needs;\\n- innovate\\nand develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- successfully\\ncommercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture\\nand deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;\\n- differentiate\\nour offerings from our competitors\\' offerings; \\n\\n20\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=20,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=132883,FOLIO=\\'20\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\' \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- price\\nour products competitively;\\n- anticipate\\nour competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control\\nproduct quality in our manufacturing process.Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced\\ninformation technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will\\ncontinue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to\\nbring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from\\nfulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsource significant portions of our information\\ntechnology (\"IT\") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to\\nperform on the part of the IT providers could impair our ability to operate effectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower\\nrevenues, unexecuted efficiencies, and impact our results of operations and our stock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to\\ngeopolitical uncertainty.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the\\nmarkets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their\\nproducts. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market upturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or\\ncomponents to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In addition, some of the parts that require custom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers\\ndue to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we would be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to\\ndiscontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In order to secure components for the production of products,\\nwe may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers, which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to\\ndeclining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and electronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is\\nless than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nOur income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match the demand for our products.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our\\nexpectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an\\n21\\nZEQ.=7,SEQ=21,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=877281,FOLIO=\\'21\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\' \\n \\nupturn\\nin one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing capacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and\\nadversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if during an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity\\nwould adversely affect our income.\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from\\ninternational operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities\\nare increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption\\nto transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n- changes\\nin foreign currency exchange rates;\\n- changes\\nin a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n- trade\\nprotection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n- negative\\nconsequences from changes in tax laws;\\n- difficulty\\nin staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing\\nlabor regulations;\\n- differing\\nprotection of intellectual property;\\n- unexpected\\nchanges in regulatory requirements; and\\n- geopolitical\\nturmoil, including terrorism and war. \\n\\n        We\\ncentralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts\\nreceivables functions. If conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of\\noperations, as well as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results. In addition, although the majority of our products are priced and paid for\\nin U.S. dollars, a significant amount of certain types of expenses, such as payroll, utilities, tax, and marketing expenses, are paid in local currencies. Our hedging programs reduce, but do not\\nalways entirely eliminate, within any given twelve month period, the impact of currency exchange rate movements, and therefore fluctuations in exchange rates, including those caused by currency\\ncontrols, could impact our business operating results and financial condition by resulting in lower revenue or increased expenses. However, for expenses beyond that twelve month period, our hedging\\nstrategy does not mitigate our exposure.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative\\npersonnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our\\nbusinesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also\\nintense competition for certain highly\\n22\\nZEQ.=8,SEQ=22,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=940390,FOLIO=\\'22\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\' \\n \\ntechnical\\nspecialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees.\\nThe impact of consolidation of competitors in the test and measurement market is difficult to predict and may harm our business.\\nThe test and measurement industry is intensely competitive and has been subject to increasing consolidation. For instance, in November 2007, Danaher\\nCorporation, one of our competitors, completed the acquisition of Tektronix, Inc., another of our competitors. Consolidation in the test and measurement industry could result in existing\\ncompetitors increasing their market share through business combinations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able\\nto compete successfully in an increasingly consolidated industry and cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect our competitors or us.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures\\nand divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in our fiscal year 2006, we completed the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and\\nspin-off of our semiconductor test solutions business, and this year we completed several acquisitions, including the acquisition of Stratagene Corporation in our third fiscal quarter. As\\na result of such\\ntransactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given fiscal quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have\\npost-closing arrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, the financial results of which can be\\ndifficult to predict. In addition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty\\ndeveloping, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected\\nsynergies. Depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:\\n- the\\nretention of key employees;\\n- the\\nmanagement of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n- the\\nretention of key customers;\\n- the\\ncompatibility of our sales programs and facilities within those of the acquired company; and\\n- the\\ncompatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company. \\n\\n        A\\nsuccessful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n- effectively\\ntransfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n- identify\\nand separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n- reduce\\nfixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. \\n\\n        Future\\nimpairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. And, our inability to timely and effectively\\napply our systems of\\n23\\nZEQ.=9,SEQ=23,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=256795,FOLIO=\\'23\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\'\\ninternal\\ncontrols to an acquired business could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\nIn\\naddition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these\\ncustomers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market\\nconditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such\\ntransactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and\\nenvironmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nSome of our properties are undergoing remediation by HP for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has agreed to\\nretain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. HP will have access to our\\nproperties to perform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require\\nus to incur unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or\\nremediation obligations. In addition, the determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and\\nlitigation.\\nWe\\nhave agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us other than those properties\\ncurrently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination\\nmay exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.\\nOur\\ncurrent and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the\\nenvironment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor\\nrelated businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related\\nto those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to\\nregulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain\\nregulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging,\\nproduct content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more\\n24\\nZEQ.=10,SEQ=24,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=370696,FOLIO=\\'24\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\' \\n \\nstringent\\nover time. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable\\ngovernment regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our\\noperations. In addition, because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.\\nOur\\nproducts and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies\\nsuch as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nSome\\nof our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S.\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the\\nmanufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply\\nwith these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing\\nour products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations, and failure to address or comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business by leading to a reduction in revenue associated with these customers.\\nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to\\ncompanies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and\\nconditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these\\nregulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.\\nA\\nnumber of our products from our bio-analytical measurement business are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") and certain similar\\nforeign regulatory agencies. If we or any of our suppliers or distributors fail to comply with FDA and other applicable regulatory requirements or are perceived to potentially have failed to comply,\\nwe may face, among other things, adverse publicity affecting both us and our customers, investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; partial\\nsuspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions, increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals; seizures or recalls of our\\nproducts or those of our customers or the inability to sell our products.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products or services.\\nWhile we do not believe that we infringe the valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of third parties, there may be potentially relevant third party\\nintellectual property rights that we are unaware of. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming due to the complexity of our\\ntechnology and the uncertainty of intellectual property\\n25\\nZEQ.=11,SEQ=25,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=990725,FOLIO=\\'25\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\' \\n \\nlitigation\\nand could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. A claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license\\nagreement, which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all, or could subject us to significant damages or to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or\\nservices.\\nWe\\noften rely on licenses of third party intellectual property that is useful for our businesses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on\\nfavorable terms or at all. Our intellectual property portfolio, which we use in negotiating licenses and asserting counterclaims, continually changes as we review and adjust the patents and other\\nintellectual property in the portfolio consistent with our business strategies. Accordingly, the amount of intellectual property that is available for us to use in our defense or for negotiations is\\ncontinually changing and may decrease.\\nThird parties may infringe our intellectual property and we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resources enforcing our rights.\\nOur success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on various intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and\\ntrade secrets, as well as confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements, to establish our proprietary rights. If we do not enforce our intellectual property rights successfully our competitive\\nposition may suffer which could harm our operating results.\\nOur\\npending patent applications, and our pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents,\\ncopyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe\\nmay need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may\\nbe harmed if we cannot detect infringement and enforce our intellectual property rights quickly or at all. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a\\ndominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing\\nnon-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries which could make it easier for\\ncompetitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some of our intellectual property is licensed to others which allows them to compete with us using that intellectual\\nproperty.\\nWe have received a Revenue Agent\\'s Report from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 claiming a significant increase in our U.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome of\\nthis examination or any future examinations involving similar claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\\nOur U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002 have been under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"). In August 2007, we received a\\nRevenue Agent\\'s Report (\"RAR\"). In the RAR, the IRS proposes to assess a net tax deficiency, after applying available net operating losses from the years under audit and undisputed tax credits, for\\nthose years of approximately $405 million, plus penalties of approximately $160 million and interest. If the IRS were to fully prevail, our net operating loss and tax credits generated\\nin recent years would be utilized earlier than they otherwise would have been and our annual effective tax rate will have increased as a result. The RAR addresses several issues. One issue, however,\\nrelating to the use of Agilent\\'s brand name by our foreign affiliates,\\n26\\nZEQ.=12,SEQ=26,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=419778,FOLIO=\\'26\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\' \\n \\naccounts\\nfor a majority of the claimed tax deficiency. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustment for this issue in particular is inconsistent with applicable tax laws and that we have meritorious\\ndefenses to this claim. Therefore we have not included any tax for this item in our tax provision for 2007. We have filed a formal protest and requested a conference with the Appeals Office of the IRS\\nand have opposed this claim, and most of the other claimed adjustments proposed in the RAR, vigorously. The final resolution of the proposed adjustments is uncertain and may take several years. Based\\non current information, it is our opinion that the ultimate disposition of these matters is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or\\nliquidity. However, if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is in excess of the tax provisions we have recorded in connection with the proposed assessment, our results of operations, financial\\ncondition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\\nWe have restructured our World Trade financing arrangement, which has increased the cost to us of this arrangement and we may have to restructure this arrangement in the future, which may further\\nincrease the cost to us. We also may be subject to the risk that our current financing arrangements could be accelerated prior to their scheduled repayment date.\\nIn January 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. (\"World Trade\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase\\nAgreement and related Confirmation (together, the \"Original Repurchase Agreement\") with Fenway Capital, LLC (the \"Counterparty\") pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an\\naggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the \"Purchased Securities\"), having an\\naggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion. Pursuant to the Original Repurchase Agreement, World Trade is obligated to repurchase the preferred shares for 100 percent of their\\naggregate liquidation preference in January 2011.\\nOn\\nSeptember 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (the \"Amended Repurchase Agreement\") and certain of the related agreements and a\\nNovation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as the Counterparty at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation (\"Merrill Lynch\"). On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered\\ninto a further amendment to the Amended Repurchase Agreement (such Amended Repurchase Agreement as amended, the \"Repurchase Agreement\") and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement\\nin order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as the Counterparty at the request of Merrill Lynch. On December 7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Repurchase\\nAgreement among Agilent, Merrill and World Trade (the \"Related Agreement\"). Pursuant to the terms of the Repurchase Agreement and Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make quarterly payments\\nto the Counterparty at a rate per annum equal to either (i) the cost of funds to the Counterparty plus 20 basis points, or (ii) three-month LIBOR plus 52 basis points\\nAs\\nprovided in Related Agreement, at any time after February 5, 2008, Merrill Lynch may require that World Trade accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the\\nPurchased Securities to a date designated by Merrill Lynch that is no earlier than 120 days from the date that Merrill Lynch provides notice. Agilent may restructure the terms of this\\ntransaction or may pursue a new transaction to replace this transaction. There can be no assurances as to the timing or terms of any such restructuring or new transaction, and any such restructuring\\nor new transaction may result in an increase in the cost of this transaction to Agilent.\\n27\\nZEQ.=13,SEQ=27,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=606154,FOLIO=\\'27\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\'\\nWe have issued $600 million in a debt offering and entered into a credit facility and may incur other debt in the future, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity and\\nresults of operations.\\nIn October 2007, we issued $600 million in senior unsecured notes. In addition, in May 2007, we entered into a five-year senior\\nunsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to $300 million. Although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility, we may use the proceeds\\nof any future borrowing for general corporate purposes, future acquisitions, repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock or expansion of our business.\\nOur\\nincurrence of this debt may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition by, among other things:\\n- increasing\\nour vulnerability to downturns in our business, to competitive pressures and to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n- requiring\\nthe dedication of a portion of our expected cash from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other\\npurposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and\\n- limiting\\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry. \\n\\n        Our\\ncurrent revolving credit facility imposes restrictions on us, including restrictions on our ability to create liens on our assets and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur\\nindebtedness, and requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to comply with these ratios may be affected by events beyond our control. In addition, our\\nlong-term non-convertible debt includes covenants that may adversely affect our ability to incur certain liens or engage in certain types of sale and leaseback transactions. If\\nwe breach any of the covenants under our long-term debt or our revolving credit facility and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our\\noutstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable.\\nWe have substantial cash requirements in the United States while a majority of our cash is generated outside of the United States. The failure to maintain a level of cash sufficient to address our\\ncash requirements in the United States could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\nAlthough cash generated in the United States covers normal operating requirements, a substantial amount of additional cash is required for special purposes such\\nas repurchases of our stock, acquisitions of third parties, and the refinancing at maturity of our $1.5 billion obligation related to our World Trade financing arrangement. Our business\\noperating results, financial condition, and strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted if we were unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through (1) the efficient and timely\\nrepatriations of overseas cash or (2) other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost.\\nIf we suffer a loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made\\ndisasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent\\nTechnologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to\\nexperience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since\\n28\\nZEQ.=14,SEQ=28,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=371306,FOLIO=\\'28\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\' \\n \\nwe\\nhave consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry insurance for\\nproperty damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism.\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could harm our brands and operating results.\\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant\\nresources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, Section 404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\\nrequires that we assess and our auditors attest to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement\\nfor each fiscal year will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, an important part of our growth strategy\\nhas been, and will likely continue to be, the acquisition of complementary businesses, and we expect these systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate\\nacquisitions and our business grows. Likewise, the complexity of our systems and controls may become more difficult to manage as we transform our operating structure and continue to reduce\\ninfrastructure costs. To effectively manage these changes, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We cannot be\\ncertain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in light of likely future\\nacquisitions of companies that are not in compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, difficulties encountered in\\ntheir implementation or operation, or difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause it to fail to meet our financial\\nreporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our\\nstock and our access to capital.',\n",

(\"we\", \"Agilent\" or the \"company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is the world\\'s premier measurement company\\nproviding core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries.\\nWe\\nhave two business segments comprised of the electronic measurement business and the bio-analytical measurement business. Our electronic measurement business focuses on the\\ncommunications and electronics industries, while our bio-analytical measurement business focuses on the life sciences industry and in the environmental, chemical, food and petrochemical\\nindustries and in materials sciences. In addition to our two businesses, we conduct centralized research through Agilent Technologies Laboratories (\"Agilent Labs\"). Each of our businesses, including\\nAgilent Labs, is supported by our general infrastructure organization, which provides shared services in the areas of finance, information technology, legal, workplace services and human resources.\\nWe\\nsell our products primarily through direct sales, but we also utilize distributors, resellers, manufacturer\\'s representatives, telesales and electronic commerce. Of our total net\\nrevenue of $5.42 billion for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2007, we generated 34 percent in the U.S. and 66 percent outside the U.S. As of October 31, 2007, we\\nemployed approximately 19,400 people worldwide. Our primary research and development and manufacturing sites are in California, Colorado, Delaware and Washington in the U.S. and in China, Germany,\\nIndia, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\\nIn\\nthe beginning of the third quarter of 2007, we moved the nanopositioning products from the electronics measurement segment to more closely align with the new materials sciences\\nbusiness in the bio-analytical measurement segment.

Agilent Labs engages primarily in two types of research: 1) applied research that leads to technology that can be transferred to our existing\\nbusinesses in communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis, and 2) research that creates new businesses that are outside of our\\ncurrent markets but within our fields of interest. Agilent Labs also provides technology integration across our company.\\nAgilent\\nLabs employs approximately 200 people. Agilent Labs\\' technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific fields, such as biology, bioinformatics,\\nchemistry, computer science, distributed measurement, electrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, measurement software, optics, physics, physiology, semiconductor device\\ndesign and signal processing.\\nGeneral Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our businesses through our general infrastructure and shared services organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance,\\nlegal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. These organizations are generally headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of\\nOctober 2007, our general infrastructure and shared services organizations employed approximately 2,500 people, which includes 200 Agilent Labs employees.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and\\nDisposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenditures were $685 million in 2007, $655 million in 2006 and $650 million in 2005, the vast majority of\\nwhich was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative,\\nhigh-quality products and services.\\n14\\nZEQ.=12,SEQ=14,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=975963,FOLIO=\\'14\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DE12801A.;6\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\' \\n THIS IS THE END OF A COMPOSITION COMPONENT\\nTOC_END \\nBacklog\\nOn October 31, 2007, our unfilled orders were unchanged from last year for the electronic measurement business at approximately $750 million. On\\nOctober 31, 2007, our unfilled orders for the bio-analytical measurement business were approximately $290 million, as compared to approximately $280 million at\\nOctober 31, 2006. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for both businesses will be delivered to customers within nine months. On average, our unfilled orders represent\\napproximately two months\\' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of short-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable\\nindicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe generate patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While\\nwe believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights have value, in general no single license, patent or other intellectual property right is in itself material. In addition,\\nour intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or may otherwise not provide significant competitive advantage.\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and\\nsheet metal. Both our electronic and bio-analytical measurement businesses purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. No single supplier is material, although some\\nof the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term\\nrelationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their\\nlead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at\\nall. To address the potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesign of products for alternative components. In\\naddition, while we generally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase incremental inventory as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws\\ngoverning health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to\\nregulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and\\nsafety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent\\nwill not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content\\nrequirements. These laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures.\\nSome\\nof our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by our former parent company, Hewlett-Packard Company (\"HP\"). As\\npart of the initial separation agreement from HP in 1999, HP has agreed to retain the\\n15\\nZEQ.=1,SEQ=15,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=294147,FOLIO=\\'15\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\'\\nliability\\nfor the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The determination of the existence and cost of any\\nadditional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet its remediation and indemnification obligations\\nin this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference\\nwith on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required\\nto incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. Remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties.\\nIn\\naddition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us\\nwith respect to that subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental\\nagencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect HP\\'s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.\\nWe\\nare liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are\\nindemnifying HP for any liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or\\ndiscontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with such indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination\\nor regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe\\nare being indemnified by HP with respect to all environmental liabilities for which HP accrued a reserve, and we are not aware of any material environmental liabilities being assumed\\nby us which are not subject to the indemnity.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 66 percent in fiscal 2007, 66 percent in\\nfiscal 2006 and 64 percent in fiscal 2005, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Approximately 12 percent of our annual revenue in each of the last\\nthree years was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally attributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative.\\nLong-lived\\nassets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 55 percent in fiscal 2007,\\n55 percent in fiscal year 2006 and 50 percent in fiscal year 2005. Approximately 16, 19 and 17 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal years\\n2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.\\nMost\\nof our sales in international markets are made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors.\\nHowever, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur\\ninternational business is subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished\\ngoods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, consequences from changes in\\ntax laws\\n16\\nZEQ.=2,SEQ=16,EFW=\"2181802\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=978359,FOLIO=\\'16\\',FILE=\\'DISK114:[07ZDW1.07ZDW12801]DG12801A.;10\\',USER=\\'DNICHOL\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2007;13:40\\'\\nand\\nregulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations, differing protection of intellectual property and geopolitical turmoil, including\\nterrorism and war. We are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales and expenses, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies\\nother than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate risk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment and finance receivable portfolios we hold. The U.S. and\\ninternational community\\'s response to recent terrorist activities could exacerbate these risks. For example, there may be an increased risk of political unrest in regions where we have significant\\nmanufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse\\neconomic changes in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 21, \"Segment Information\", to our consolidated financial statements.\\nAcquisition and Disposal of Material Assets\\nOn November 28, 2005, we completed the sale of our stake in Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. (\"Lumileds\") to Philips pursuant to a Share Purchase\\nAgreement (the \"Share Purchase Agreement\") dated as of August 12, 2005 among Agilent, Agilent LED International, Philips Lumileds Holding B.V. and Philips. Under the terms of the Share Purchase\\nAgreement, Agilent received $949 million in cash proceeds, as well as approximately $51 million in repayment of outstanding advances to Lumileds and interest due to Agilent.\\nIn\\nDecember 2005, we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of our semiconductor products business to Avago pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated as of\\nAugust 14, 2005 and amended November 30, 2005 (the \"Asset Purchase Agreement\"). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Agilent received approximately $2.6 billion in\\ncash proceeds.\\nOn\\nOctober 31, 2006, we distributed Agilent\\'s equity interest in Verigy by means of a dividend to our stockholders. Prior to the distribution, on June 1, 2006, Agilent\\ntransferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its semiconductor test solutions business to Verigy, then a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent. In June and July 2006, Verigy sold\\napproximately 8.7 million of its ordinary shares, or approximately 15 percent of its outstanding shares, in an initial public offering. On October 31, 2006, the aggregate market\\nvalue of the Verigy shares which were distributed was $840 million.\\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\\nThe names of our current executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies appear below:\\nDavid S.

Notable are efforts by the National Institute of Health, the National Cancer Institute, and EORTC (European\\nOrganization), EMBL (Europe), Singapore Genomics Institute, and National Translational Cancer Research Network (UK). In addition large donations by private foundations are also fueling growth in this\\nkey market segment.\\nThe Clinical Diagnostic Market.\\nThe clinical diagnostic market is an emerging growth\\nopportunity that could be addressed by\\nleveraging existing platforms like microfluidics, microarrays, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The clinical diagnostic market is viewed by us as an area for strategic growth.\\nChemical Analysis Markets\\nOur chemical analysis markets accounted for approximately 57 percent of revenue from the bio-analytical measurement business in 2006. Within\\nchemical analysis, we focus primarily on the following areas: petrochemical, environmental, homeland security and forensics, and bioagriculture and food safety.\\nThe Petroleum and Chemical Market.\\nThe natural gas and petroleum refining markets use\\nour products to measure and control\\nthe quality of their finished products and to verify the environmental safety of their operations. Petroleum refiners use our measurement solutions to analyze crude oil composition, perform raw\\nmaterial analysis, verify and improve refining processes\\n9\\nZEQ.=7,SEQ=9,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=3276,FOLIO=\\'9\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DE1318A.;9\\',USER=\\'CMATTI\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2006;21:46\\'\\nand\\nensure the overall quality of gasoline, fuels, lubricants and other products. Solutions based on gas chromotography, liquid chromotography and mass spectrometry products are also used in the\\ndevelopment, manufacturing and quality control of fine chemicals. Our gas chromatographs are also used to monitor consistent quality in the delivery of natural gas.\\nThe Environmental Market.\\nOur gas chromatography, liquid chromatography and mass\\nspectrometry solutions are used by the\\nenvironmental market for applications such as laboratory and field analysis of chemical pollutants in air, water, soil and solid waste. Environmental industry customers include all levels of\\ngovernment, the industrial and manufacturing sectors, engineering and consulting companies, commercial testing laboratories and colleges and universities.\\nThe Forensics and Homeland Security Market.\\nOur liquid chromatography, gas\\nchromatography, mass spectrometry and\\nmicrofluidics solutions are used by health and forensics laboratories in the U.S. and abroad, particularly in the analysis of evidence associated with crime or with the detection and identification of\\nbiological and chemical warfare agents. This instrumentation is either used in static or mobile laboratories. Customers include local, state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies and\\nhealth laboratories.\\nThe Bioagriculture and Food Safety Market.\\nFood safety industries apply the same general\\ntechnologies for chemical analysis\\nas the pharmaceutical and environmental markets, including gas and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. For example, our mass spectrometer portfolio, including recently introduced liquid\\nchromatography mass spectrometers, are used to analyze residual pesticides in food. Additionally, bioagriculture industries seek to improve crops and foods by conducting research on these organisms,\\nas well as testing for genetically modified content, using microarray and microfluidics solutions.\\nBio-Analytical Measurement Products\\nA key factor in all of our bio-analytical measurement target markets is the need for new products that increase customer productivity and provide high\\nquality data that enable decision-making by our customers.\\nMicroarray Products\\nSince announcing the launch of our DNA microarray program for the life sciences in December 1999, we have become a leading supplier of microarray solutions\\nwhich we sell primarily to pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies in our for-profit markets, as well as academic and government funded organizations in our\\nnot-for-profit markets. Using our refined inkjet manufacturing process, we make highly sensitive 60-mer oligonucleotide, or oligo, microarrays. This unique inkjet\\nprocess is highly flexible and accurate, enabling the faster manufacture of high quality custom microarrays. In 2006, we expanded our line of microarrays to offer a new line of\\nhigh-density arrays providing enhanced genomics solutions for a variety of applications.\\nMicrofluidics Products\\nThe Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer is the first commercial microfluidics product for the analysis of a wide range of biological molecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins\\nand cells. The bioanalyzer chips allow sample quality assessment to be done in a fraction of the usual time using fewer samples and reagents than traditional gel electrophoresis. We also provide\\nrelated software, which enables the bioanalyzer to be used for the development and manufacture of protein-based therapeutics. The bioanalyzer is commonly used in genomics laboratories and has enabled\\nthe standardization of RNA quality measurement.\\n10\\nZEQ.=8,SEQ=10,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=576505,FOLIO=\\'10\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DE1318A.;9\\',USER=\\'CMATTI\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2006;21:46\\' \\n \\n\\n Gas Chromatography Products\\nAgilent is the world\\'s leading provider of gas chromatographs, both laboratory and portable models. A gas chromatograph (\"GC\") is used to separate any gas, liquid\\nor solid that can be vaporized and then detect the molecules present to determine their identity and quantity. We continue to expand the application space for our GCs with the development of new\\nseparation columns and product enhancements. Over the last three years, Agilent has introduced updated and advanced models of all of its major gas chromatography platforms.\\nLiquid Chromatography Products\\nA liquid chromatograph (\"LC\") or a high performance liquid chromatograph (\"HPLC\") is used to separate molecules of a liquid mixture to determine the quantity and\\nidentity of the molecules present. Used when sample vaporization is not an option, LC also separates and detects compounds to determine molecular identity and quantity. Our LC instruments are modular\\nin construction and can be configured to form instruments that perform specific analyses. Agilent\\'s HPLC system, the Agilent 1100 Series, has sold over 60,000 systems since its introduction, and this\\nyear was replaced by its successor, the 1200 Series LC. The 1200 Series is an advanced\\nversion which enables true \"fast chromatography\" through both pressure and temperature control. As a leader in liquid chromatography, we continue to expand our application space with new HPLC columns\\nand ongoing product enhancements. Our latest innovation, HPLC-Chip, is fully commercialized and creating demand for nano LC solutions across many markets.\\nMass Spectrometry Products\\nA mass spectrometer (\"MS\") identifies and quantifies chemicals based on a chemical\\'s molecular mass and on characteristic patterns of fragment masses that result\\nwhen a molecule is broken apart. Mass spectrometry is an important tool in analyzing proteins and other biological entities that undergo transformations because it enables the understanding and\\ncharacterization of their many different states. MS systems are typically used in combination with gas or liquid chromatographs. In the past three years, Agilent significantly expanded its mass\\nspectrometry portfolio with a focus on reliability, sensitivity and ease of use. This year, we introduced two new LC/MS platforms, the Agilent 6410 Triple Quadrapole MS and the 6510\\nQuadrapole-Time of Flight MS. These new platforms serve new and growing markets for Agilent.\\nSoftware and Informatics Products\\nWe provide software for instrument control, data acquisition, data analysis, laboratory content and business process management, and informatics. Our software\\nfacilitates the regulatory-compliant use of instruments in pharmaceutical quality assurance/quality control environments. In 2005, we completed the acquisitions of Scientific Software, Inc. and\\nSilicon Genetics, Inc., expanding our portfolio of chromatography data systems and providing an entry into bioinformatics. The integration of these companies into Agilent has expanded our\\nportfolio and market opportunities.\\nConsumables and Services\\nWe also offer a broad range of consumable products, which support our LC, GC and MS technology platforms. These consumable products include chemical standards,\\ninstrument replacement parts, brand-specific chromatography columns and consumable supplies to meet our customers\\' analysis needs. All of our products, which include generic and proprietary supplies,\\nare designed to work together.\\n11\\nZEQ.=9,SEQ=11,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=732254,FOLIO=\\'11\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DE1318A.;9\\',USER=\\'CMATTI\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2006;21:46\\' \\n \\n        We\\noffer a wide range of startup, operational, educational and compliance support services for our measurement and data handling systems. Our support services include maintenance,\\ntroubleshooting, repair and training for all of our chemical and bioinstrumentation analysis hardware and software products. Special service bundles have also been designed to meet the specific\\napplication needs of various industries.\\nBio-Analytical Measurement Customers\\nWe have roughly 21,000 customers, and as of the end of fiscal 2006, no single customer represented greater than 10 percent of the net revenue of the\\nbusiness. The bio-analytical measurement business is susceptible to seasonality in its orders and revenues primarily based on U.S. government and large pharmaceutical company budgets. The\\nresult is that our first and fourth fiscal quarters tend to deliver the strongest profits for this group. However, general economic trends, new product introductions and competition might overshadow\\nthis trend in any given year.\\nBio-Analytical Measurement Sales, Marketing and Support\\nOur sales and support delivery channels are aligned by key markets. We market products to our customers through direct sales, electronic commerce, resellers,\\nmanufacturers\\' representatives and distributors. Additionally, we are optimizing our worldwide distribution capabilities to address high-growth opportunities such as the environmental,\\nfood safety and pharmaceutical markets in the Asia-Pacific region.\\nWe\\nuse direct sales to market our solutions to all of our pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical accounts, large- and medium-sized chemical customers and environmental accounts. Sales\\nagents supplement direct sales by providing broader geographic coverage and coverage of smaller accounts. Our active reseller program augments our ability to provide more complete solutions to our\\ncustomers. We sell our consumable products through distributors, telesales and electronic commerce.\\nWe\\ndeliver our support services to customers in a variety of ways, including on-site assistance with repair or exchange of returned products, telephone support and\\nself-diagnostic services provided over the Internet. We also offer special industry-focused service bundles that are designed to meet the specific needs of hydrocarbon processing,\\nenvironmental, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical customers to keep instruments fully operational and compliant with the respective industry requirements. Our products typically come with standard\\nwarranties, and extended warranties are available for additional cost.\\nBio-Analytical Measurement Manufacturing\\nOur manufacturing supports our diverse product range and customer-centric focus. We assemble highly configurable products to individual customer orders and make\\nstandard products to stock. We employ advanced manufacturing techniques and supply chain management systems to reduce costs and manufacturing cycle times. We selectively use third parties to provide\\nmanufacturing capabilities outside our core competencies, such as the manufacture of printed circuit assemblies and the delivery of shipment logistics. We have manufacturing facilities in California\\nand Delaware in the U.S., China, Germany and Japan. We utilize just-in-time manufacturing and so typically do not maintain a high level of inventory.\\nBio-Analytical Measurement Competition\\nThe markets for analytical instruments in which we compete are characterized by evolving industry standards and intense competition. Our principal competitors in\\nthe life sciences arena include: Affymetrix, Inc., Applied Biosystems Inc., GE Healthcare, Invitrogen Corp., Thermo Electron\\n12\\nZEQ.=10,SEQ=12,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=953921,FOLIO=\\'12\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DE1318A.;9\\',USER=\\'CMATTI\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2006;21:46\\' \\n \\nCorp.\\nand Waters Corp. Our principal competitors in the chemical analysis arena include: Applied Biosystems Inc., Perkin Elmer Corp., Shimadzu Corporation, Thermo Electron Corp. and\\nVarian, Inc. Agilent competes on the basis of price, product performance, reliability, support quality, applications expertise and global channel coverage.\\nBio-Analytical Measurement Government Regulation\\nThe analysis products and related consumables marketed by our chemical analysis business are subject to regulation in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection\\nAgency (\"EPA\") under the Toxic Substances Control Act and by government agencies in other countries under similar laws. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulations govern, among other things, the\\ntesting, manufacture, processing and distribution of chemicals, the testing of regulated chemicals for their effects on human health and safety and import and export of chemicals. The Toxic Substances\\nControl Act prohibits persons from manufacturing any chemical in the U.S. that has not been reviewed by EPA for its effect on health and safety, and placed on an EPA inventory of chemical substances.\\nTherefore, we must continually adapt our chemical analysis products to changing regulations. If we fail to comply with the notification, record-keeping and other requirements in the manufacture or\\ndistribution of our products, the EPA can obtain an order from a court that would prohibit the further distribution or marketing of a product that does not comply or we could face fines, civil\\npenalties or criminal prosecution.\\nAgilent Technologies Laboratories\\nAgilent Labs is our central research organization based in Santa Clara, California, with satellite offices in Beijing, China; Everett, Washington; Leuven,\\nBelgium; and South Queensferry, Scotland. Agilent Labs engages primarily in two types of research: 1) applied research that leads to technology that can be transferred to our existing\\nbusinesses in communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis, and 2) research that creates new businesses that are outside of our\\ncurrent markets but within our fields of interest. Agilent Labs also provides technology integration across our company.\\nAgilent\\nLabs employs approximately 200 people. Agilent Labs\\' technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific fields, such as biology, bioinformatics,\\nchemistry, computer science, distributed measurement, electrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, measurement software, optics, physics, physiology, semiconductor device\\ndesign and signal processing.\\nGeneral Infrastructure Organization\\nWe provide support to our businesses through our general infrastructure and shared services organization. This support includes services in the areas of finance,\\nlegal, workplace services, human resources and information technology. These organizations are generally headquartered in Santa Clara, California, with services provided worldwide. As of the end of\\nOctober 2006, our general infrastructure and shared services organizations employed approximately 2,750 people, which includes 200 Agilent Labs employees.\\n13\\nZEQ.=11,SEQ=13,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=705029,FOLIO=\\'13\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DE1318A.;9\\',USER=\\'CMATTI\\',CD=\\'21-DEC-2006;21:46\\' \\n THIS IS THE END OF A COMPOSITION COMPONENT\\nTOC_END \\n\\n        The following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog, Intellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and\\nDisposal of Material Assets include information common to each of our businesses.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenditures were $655 million in 2006, $650 million in 2005 and $599 million in 2004, the vast majority of\\nwhich was company-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative,\\nhigh-quality products and services.\\nBacklog\\nAt October 31, 2006, our unfilled orders for the electronic measurement business amounted to approximately $700 million, as compared to\\napproximately $670 million at October 31, 2005. At October 31, 2006, our unfilled orders for the bio-analytical measurement business were approximately\\n$260 million, as compared to approximately $180 million at October 31, 2005. We expect that a large majority of the unfilled orders for both businesses will be delivered to\\ncustomers within nine months. On average, our unfilled orders represent approximately two months\\' worth of revenues. In light of this experience, backlog on any particular date, while indicative of\\nshort-term revenue performance, is not necessarily a reliable indicator of medium or long-term revenue performance.\\nIntellectual Property\\nOur general policy has been to seek patent and other intellectual property protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our\\nproducts and services or to give us a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and applications have value, in general no single patent or license is in itself material. In\\naddition, there can be no assurance that any of our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that our rights will provide significant competitive advantages.\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins and\\nsheet metal. Both our electronic and bio-analytical measurement businesses purchase materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. No single supplier is material, although some\\nof the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term\\nrelationships with suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even so, some suppliers may still extend their\\nlead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly or at all. To address\\nthe potential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesign of products for alternative components. In addition, while we\\ngenerally attempt to keep our inventory at minimal levels, we do purchase of incremental inventory for supply buffer as circumstances warrant to protect the supply chain.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws\\ngoverning health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to\\nregulation imposed by foreign\\n14\\nZEQ.=1,SEQ=14,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=279644,FOLIO=\\'14\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DG1318A.;8\\',USER=\\'CGUNDER\\',CD=\\'22-DEC-2006;14:48\\'\\ngovernments.\\nWe believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. However, the risk of\\nenvironmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur\\nsignificant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. These laws are\\ngradually becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures.\\nSome\\nof our operations are located on properties that are known to have subsurface contamination undergoing remediation by HP. As part of our spin-off from HP in 1999, HP has\\nagreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination. The\\ndetermination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that HP will meet\\nits remediation and indemnification obligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with HP, HP will have access to these properties to perform the\\nremediation. HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will\\nnot be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation. Remediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and value\\nof the properties.\\nIn\\naddition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by HP under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although HP has agreed to indemnify us\\nwith respect to that subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect\\nHP\\'s obligation to indemnify us with regard to these matters.\\nWe\\nare liable and are indemnifying HP for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by HP excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are\\nindemnifying HP for any liability associated with past non-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties transferred to us by HP, as well as at sold or\\ndiscontinued businesses that are related to our businesses.

Risk Factors\\nRisks, Uncertainties and Other Factors That May Affect Future Results\\nOur operating results and financial condition could be harmed if the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated.\\nVisibility into our markets is limited. Our quarterly sales and operating results are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the\\nquarter, which are difficult to forecast. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on\\nthe expected seasonality or cyclicality of our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the seasonality or cyclicality that we expect. Any decline in our customers\\' markets or\\nin general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. For example, if the Asia Pacific market does not grow as anticipated, our results could\\nsuffer. The broader semiconductor market is one of the drivers for our electronic measurement business, and therefore, a decrease in the semiconductor market could harm our electronic measurement\\nbusiness. Also, if our customers\\' markets decline, we may not be able to collect on outstanding amounts due to us. Such decline could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations,\\ncash flows and stock price, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability. Also, in such an environment, pricing pressures could intensify. Since a significant portion of our operating expenses\\nis relatively fixed in nature due to sales, research and development and manufacturing costs, if we were unable to respond quickly enough these pricing pressures could further reduce our gross\\nmargins.\\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to maintain a reduced cost structure, and the actions that we take in order to reduce costs could have long-term adverse effects on our business.\\nWe have taken, and continue to take, various actions to transition our company to a reduced cost structure. For example, in fiscal year 2005, we announced the\\nrestructuring of our global infrastructure organization to reduce costs by $450 million. This program has not yet been completed.\\nThere\\nare several risks inherent in our efforts to maintain a reduced cost structure. These include the risks that we will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough and hold them\\nat a level necessary to sustain or increase profitability and that we may have to undertake further restructuring initiatives that would entail additional charges. For example, a reduced cost\\nstructure could lead to increases in demand for items like travel, training, consultants, manufacturing and operating supplies, as we experienced in parts of 2004. As we transform our infrastructure,\\nwe expect to face ongoing pressure to control expenses. If we are not able to hold down expenses we may have to further reduce our workforce. There is also the risk that cost-cutting\\ninitiatives will impair our ability to effectively develop and market products, to remain competitive in the industries in which we compete and to operate effectively. Each of the above measures could\\nhave long-term effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent, decreasing or slowing improvements in our products, making it more\\n18\\nZEQ.=5,SEQ=18,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=254329,FOLIO=\\'18\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DG1318A.;8\\',USER=\\'CGUNDER\\',CD=\\'22-DEC-2006;14:48\\'\\ndifficult\\nfor us to respond to customers, limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key\\npersonnel. These circumstances could cause our income to be lower than it otherwise might be, which would adversely affect our stock price.\\nIf we do not introduce successful new products and services in a timely manner, our products and services will become obsolete, and our operating results will suffer.\\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing\\nindustry standards. In addition, many of the markets in which we operate are seasonal and cyclical. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and\\nservices will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors,\\nincluding our ability to:\\n- properly\\nidentify customer needs;\\n- innovate\\nand develop new technologies, services and applications;\\n- successfully\\ncommercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\\n- manufacture\\nand deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time;\\n- differentiate\\nour offerings from our competitors\\' offerings;\\n- price\\nour products competitively;\\n- anticipate\\nour competitors\\' development of new products, services or technological innovations; and\\n- control\\nproduct quality in our manufacturing process.Dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market and damage our reputation. Dependence on outsourced\\ninformation technology and other administrative functions may impair our ability to operate effectively.\\nAs part of our efforts to streamline operations and to cut costs, we have been outsourcing aspects of our manufacturing processes and other functions and will\\ncontinue to evaluate additional outsourcing. If our contract manufacturers or other outsourcers fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, our ability to\\nbring products to market and our reputation could suffer. For example, during a market upturn, our contract manufacturers may be unable to meet our demand requirements, which may preclude us from\\nfulfilling our customers\\' orders on a timely basis. The ability of these manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control. In addition, we outsourced significant portions of our information\\ntechnology (\"IT\") function and other administrative functions. Since IT is critical to our operations, any failure to perform on the part of the IT providers could impair our ability to operate\\neffectively. In addition to the risks outlined above, problems with manufacturing or IT outsourcing could result in lower revenues, unexecuted efficiencies, impact our results of operations and our\\nstock price. Much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries and, as a result, may be subject to geopolitical uncertainty.\\nFailure to adjust our purchases due to changing market conditions or failure to estimate our customers\\' demand could adversely affect our income.\\nOur income could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our purchases to market fluctuations, including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the\\nmarkets in which we operate. The sale of our products and services are dependent, to a large degree, on customers whose industries are\\n19\\nZEQ.=6,SEQ=19,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=260428,FOLIO=\\'19\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DG1318A.;8\\',USER=\\'CGUNDER\\',CD=\\'22-DEC-2006;14:48\\' \\n \\nsubject\\nto seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products. For example, the consumer electronics market is particularly volatile, making demand difficult to anticipate. During a market\\nupturn, we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components to meet increasing product demand, which could materially affect our results. In addition, some of the parts that require\\ncustom design are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Should a supplier cease manufacturing such a component, we\\nwould be forced to reengineer our product. In addition to discontinuing parts, suppliers may also extend lead times, limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. In\\norder to secure components for the production of products, we may continue to enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with vendors, or at times make advance payments to suppliers,\\nwhich could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to declining market demands. Prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our communications and\\nelectronics products has decreased. If demand for our products is less than we expect, we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges.\\nOur income may suffer if our manufacturing capacity does not match our demand.\\nBecause we cannot immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structures to rapidly changing market conditions, when demand does not meet our\\nexpectations, our manufacturing capacity will likely exceed our production requirements. If, during a general market upturn or an upturn in one of our segments, we cannot increase our manufacturing\\ncapacity to meet product demand, we will not be able to fulfill orders in a timely manner. This inability could materially and adversely limit our ability to improve our results. By contrast, if\\nduring an economic downturn we had excess manufacturing capacity, then our fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity would adversely affect our income.\\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our results of operations.\\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We anticipate that revenue from\\ninternational operations will continue to represent a majority of our total revenue. In addition, many of our employees, contract manufacturers, suppliers, job functions and manufacturing facilities\\nare increasingly located outside the U.S. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\\n- interruption\\nto transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers;\\n- changes\\nin foreign currency exchange rates;\\n- changes\\nin a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political, economic or other conditions;\\n- trade\\nprotection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\\n- negative\\nconsequences from changes in tax laws;\\n- difficulty\\nin staffing and managing widespread operations;\\n- differing\\nlabor regulations;\\n- differing\\nprotection of intellectual property;\\n- unexpected\\nchanges in regulatory requirements; and\\n- geopolitical\\nturmoil, including terrorism and war. \\n\\n        We\\ncentralized most of our accounting processes to two locations: India and Malaysia. These processes include general accounting, cost accounting, accounts payable and accounts\\nreceivables\\n20\\nZEQ.=7,SEQ=20,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=6056,FOLIO=\\'20\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DG1318A.;8\\',USER=\\'CGUNDER\\',CD=\\'22-DEC-2006;14:48\\'\\nfunctions.\\nIf conditions change in those countries, it may adversely affect operations, including impairing our ability to pay our suppliers and collect our receivables. Our results of operations, as\\nwell as our liquidity, may be adversely affected and possible delays may occur in reporting financial results.\\nOur business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel.\\nOur future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research, engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing, executive and administrative\\npersonnel. If we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel, we will not be able to maintain or expand our business. The markets in which we operate are very dynamic, and our\\nbusinesses continue to respond with reorganizations, workforce reductions and site closures. We believe our pay levels are very competitive within the regions that we operate. However, there is also\\nintense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit, and it may become more difficult to retain our key employees.\\nOur acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected.\\nIn the normal course of business, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures\\nand divestitures, and generally expect to complete several transactions per year. For example, in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, we\\ncompleted the divestiture of our semiconductor products business and spin-off of Verigy. During the same period, we completed 4 acquisitions of companies or businesses. As a result of such\\ntransactions, our financial results may differ from our own or the investment community\\'s expectations in a given quarter, or over the long term. Such transactions often have post-closing\\narrangements including but not limited to post-closing adjustments, transition services, escrows or indemnifications, or the financial results of which can be difficult to predict. In\\naddition, acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture, management team and business infrastructure. We may have difficulty developing, manufacturing\\nand marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies. Depending on the\\nsize and complexity of an acquisition, our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors, including:\\n- the\\nretention of key employees;\\n- the\\nmanagement of facilities and employees in different geographic areas;\\n- the\\nretention of key customers;\\n- the\\ncompatibility of our sales programs and facilities within those of the acquired company; and\\n- the\\ncompatibility of our existing infrastructure with that of an acquired company. \\n\\n        A\\nsuccessful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to:\\n- effectively\\ntransfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to the purchaser;\\n- identify\\nand separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to keep; and\\n- reduce\\nfixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business. \\n\\n        Future\\nimpairment of the value of purchased assets and goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results. And, our inability to timely and effectively\\napply our systems of internal controls to an acquired business could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\\n21\\nZEQ.=8,SEQ=21,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=659700,FOLIO=\\'21\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DG1318A.;8\\',USER=\\'CGUNDER\\',CD=\\'22-DEC-2006;14:48\\'\\nIn\\naddition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these\\ncustomers also purchase other Agilent products. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. Further, if market\\nconditions or other factors lead us to change our strategic direction, we may not realize the expected value from such transactions. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such\\ntransactions, our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price could be negatively impacted.\\nEnvironmental contamination from past operations could subject us to unreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties involved and\\nenvironmental contamination caused by ongoing operations could subject us to substantial liabilities in the future.\\nSome of our properties are undergoing remediation by Hewlett-Packard for subsurface contaminations that were known at the time of our separation from HP. HP has\\nagreed to retain the liability for this subsurface contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of that contamination. The determination of the\\nexistence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. In addition, HP will have access to our properties to\\nperform remediation. While HP has agreed to minimize interference with on-site operations at those properties, remediation activities and subsurface contamination may require us to incur\\nunreimbursed costs and could harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties. We cannot be sure that HP will continue to fulfill its indemnification or remediation\\nobligations.\\nWe\\nhave agreed to indemnify HP for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all other properties transferred from HP to us other than those properties\\ncurrently undergoing remediation by HP. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with any potential subsurface contamination at any of those properties, subsurface contamination\\nmay exist, and we may be exposed to material liability as a result of the existence of that contamination.\\nOur\\ncurrent and historical manufacturing processes involve, or have involved, the use of substances regulated under various international, federal, state and local laws governing the\\nenvironment. As a result, we may become subject to liabilities for environmental contamination, and these liabilities may be substantial. While we have divested substantially all of our semiconductor\\nrelated businesses to Avago and Verigy and regardless of indemnification arrangements with those parties, we may still become subject to liabilities for historical environmental contamination related\\nto those businesses. Although our policy is to apply strict standards for environmental protection at our sites inside and outside the U.S., even if the sites outside the U.S. are not subject to\\nregulations imposed by foreign governments, we may not be aware of all conditions that could subject us to liability.\\nOur customers and we are subject to various governmental regulations, compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain\\nregulations, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\\nOur businesses are subject to various significant international, federal, state and local regulations, including but not limited to health and safety, packaging,\\nproduct content, labor and import/export regulations. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We may be required to incur significant\\nexpenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations. Any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our\\noperations or portions of our operations, product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations. In\\n22\\nZEQ.=9,SEQ=22,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=466379,FOLIO=\\'22\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DG1318A.;8\\',USER=\\'CGUNDER\\',CD=\\'22-DEC-2006;14:48\\' \\n \\naddition,\\nbecause many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries, we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products.\\nOur\\nproducts and operations are also often subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies, like the International Standards Organization, as well as regulation by other agencies\\nsuch as the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. We also must comply with work safety rules. If we fail to adequately address any of these regulations, our businesses could be harmed.\\nSome\\nof our chemical analysis products are used in conjunction with chemicals whose manufacture, processing, distribution and notification requirements are regulated by the U.S.\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and by regulatory bodies in other countries with laws similar to the Toxic Substances Control Act. We must conform the\\nmanufacture, processing, distribution of and notification about these chemicals to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. If we fail to comply\\nwith these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products, then we could be made to pay civil penalties, face criminal prosecution and, in some cases, be prohibited from distributing\\nour products in commerce until the products or component substances are brought into compliance.\\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts, and failure to address these laws and regulations or comply with government contracts could harm our business by leading to a\\nreduction in revenue associated with these customers.\\nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to\\ncompanies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and\\nconditions that are not applicable to private contracts. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these\\nregulations might result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative penalties.\\nThird parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.\\nWhile we do not believe that any of our products infringe the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may be unaware of intellectual property\\nrights of others that may cover some of our technology, products or services. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could\\ndivert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Claims of\\nintellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly license agreements, and we may not be able to obtain license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may\\nbe subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products.\\nWe\\noften rely on licenses of intellectual property useful for our businesses. We cannot ensure that these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. Our\\nintellectual property portfolio, which we use in negotiating licenses and asserting counterclaims, has changed as a result of our divestitures and the Verigy spin-off. Portions of that\\nportfolio relevant to the buyer of our semiconductor products business or to Verigy are no longer available for our use except for a very limited ability to sublicense the divested and spun off\\nintellectual property. We expect the IP portfolio to continue to change as we review and adjust our IP holdings consistent with our business strategies. Accordingly, the amount of intellectual\\nproperty that we may use in our defense or for negotiations has decreased and will continue to change.

We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality\\nprovisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which\\ncould harm our operating results.\\nOur\\npending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition,\\nour patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage.\\nWe\\nmay be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be\\nharmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our intellectual property rights or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may\\nalso be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and result in lost revenues. Furthermore, some intellectual property rights\\nare licensed to other companies, allowing them to compete with us using that intellectual property.\\nWe expect to receive a Revenue Agent\\'s Report from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for 2000 through 2002 claiming a significant increase in our U.S. taxable income. An adverse outcome of this\\nexamination or any future examinations involving similar claims could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\\nOur operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the U.S. and in multiple foreign jurisdictions. These taxes are subject to review or audit by the\\nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) and state, local and foreign tax authorities. In connection with an IRS audit of our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2000 through 2002, in October 2006, we\\nreceived a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) in which the IRS claims significant increases to our U.S. taxable income which could result in a commensurate increase in our U.S. income taxes payable.\\nThis claim relates to the use of Agilent\\'s brand name by our foreign affiliates. We expect to receive a Revenue Agent\\'s Report with respect to this claim in due course in which we anticipate the IRS\\nwill assert a significant aggregate tax deficiency, plus interest and possible penalties. We believe that the claimed IRS adjustments are inconsistent with applicable tax laws. Accordingly, we will\\noppose the claimed adjustments vigorously. However, there can be no assurance that we will prevail, and, if this matter is decided adversely to us and we are required to pay a significant amount of\\nadditional U.S. taxes (and applicable interest and possible penalties) for these years, our results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\\nIf we suffer loss to our factories, facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe, our operations could be seriously harmed.\\nOur factories, facilities and distribution system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made\\ndisasters. In particular, several of our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by earthquake due to their locations. Our production facilities, headquarters and Agilent\\nTechnologies Laboratories in California, and our production facilities in Washington and Japan, are all located in areas with above-average seismic activity. If any of these facilities were to\\nexperience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. In addition, since\\n24\\nZEQ.=11,SEQ=24,EFW=\"2175273\",CP=\"AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES\",DN=\"1\",CHK=637275,FOLIO=\\'24\\',FILE=\\'DISK132:[06PAL8.06PAL1318]DG1318A.;8\\',USER=\\'CGUNDER\\',CD=\\'22-DEC-2006;14:48\\' \\n \\nwe\\nhave recently consolidated our manufacturing facilities, we are more likely to experience an interruption to our operations in the event of a catastrophe in any one location. Although we carry\\ninsurance for property damage and business interruption, we do not carry insurance or financial reserves for interruptions or potential losses arising from earthquakes or terrorism.\\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which could harm our brands and operating results.\\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable and accurate financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. We have devoted significant\\nresources and time to comply with the internal control over financial reporting requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. In addition, Section 404 under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\\nrequires that we assess and our auditors attest to the design and operating effectiveness of our controls over financial reporting. Our compliance with the annual internal control report requirement\\nfor each fiscal year will depend on the effectiveness of our financial reporting and data systems and controls across our operating subsidiaries. Furthermore, an important part of our growth strategy\\nhas been, and will likely continue to be, the acquisition of complementary businesses, and we expect these systems and controls to become increasingly complex to the extent that we integrate\\nacquisitions and our business grows. Likewise, the complexity of our systems and controls may become more difficult to manage as we transform our operating structure and continue to reduce\\ninfrastructure costs. To effectively manage these changes, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. We cannot be\\ncertain that these measures will ensure that we design, implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, especially in light of likely future\\nacquisitions of companies that are not in compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, difficulties encountered in\\ntheir implementation or operation, or difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses into our control system could harm our operating results or cause it to fail to meet our financial\\nreporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our\\nstock and our access to capital.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Item 1.    Business\\nOverview\\nAgilent\\nTechnologies, Inc. (\"we\", \"Agilent\" or \"the company\"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global diversified technology company that provides enabling solutions to markets within the communications, electronics,\\nlife sciences and chemical analysis industries. We have four primary businesses:\\n- test and measurement;\\n- automated test;\\n- semiconductor products; and\\n- life sciences and chemical analysis.\\nPrior to our initial public offering of 15.9 percent of our stock in November 1999, we were a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hewlett-Packard Company\\n(\"Hewlett-Packard\"). Hewlett-Packard distributed the remaining 84.1 percent of our stock to its stockholders on June 2, 2000 in the form of a stock dividend.\\nOur test and measurement, automated test and semiconductor products businesses focus on growth opportunities in the\\ncommunications and electronics industries, while our life sciences and chemical analysis business focuses on growth opportunities in the life sciences industry and in the environmental, chemical, food and petrochemical industries.\\nWe sell our products primarily through direct sales, but we also utilize\\ndistributors, resellers, manufacturer\\'s representatives, telesales and electronic commerce. Of our total net revenue of $7.2 billion for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004, we generated 31 percent in the United States\\n(\"U.S.\") and 69 percent outside the U.S. As of October 31, 2004, we employed approximately 28,000 people worldwide. Our primary research and development (\"R&D\") and manufacturing sites are in California, Colorado, Delaware\\nand Washington in the U.S. and in China, Germany, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\\n3\\nTable of Contents\\nOur net revenue by business segment for each of the years ending October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was:\\n|  | 2004 | 2003 | 2002 |\\n|  | (in millions) | (in millions) | (in millions) |\\n| Test and Measurement | $2,903 | $2,529 | $2,612 |\\n| Automated Test | 924 | 755 | 706 |\\n| Semiconductor Products | 2,021 | 1,586 | 1,559 |\\n| Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis | 1,333 | 1,186 | 1,133 |\\n| Total Net Revenue | $7,181 | $6,056 | $6,010 |\\nMore financial\\ninformation about our business segments is contained in Note 19, \"Segment Information,\" of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report. Hewlett-Packard accounted for approximately 4 percent of our total net\\nrevenue for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004, 5 percent for fiscal year 2003 and 8 percent for fiscal year 2002. These figures include items sold to contract manufacturers who manufacture products on Hewlett-Packard\\'s behalf.\\nTest and Measurement Business\\nOur test and measurement business provides standard and customized solutions\\nthat are used in the design, development, manufacture, installation, deployment and operation of electronics equipment and communications networks and services. These solutions include test and measurement instruments and systems, communications\\nservices and network monitoring, management and optimization tools, software design tools and related services. Related services include start-up assistance, instrument productivity and application services and instrument calibration and repair. We\\nalso offer customization, consulting and optimization services throughout the customer\\'s product lifecycle.\\nOur test and measurement business employed approximately 11,200 people as of October 31, 2004. We sell our test and measurement products through direct\\nsales, distributors, resellers, manufacturer\\'s representatives, telesales and electronic commerce. Our test and measurement business generated $2.9 billion in revenue in fiscal 2004, $2.5 billion in revenue in fiscal 2003 and $2.6 billion in\\nrevenue in fiscal 2002.\\nTest and Measurement Markets\\nOur test and measurement products compete in two\\nmajor markets:\\n- the communications test market; and\\n- the general purpose test market.\\nThe Communications Test Market\\nWe market our communications test products and services to Network Equipment Manufacturers (\"NEMs\") and communications service providers.\\nNEMs manufacture and sell products to facilitate the\\ntransmission of voice and data traffic, including network and subscriber equipment. This transmission may be in various forms, such as electronic signals over copper wire, optical signals over fiber cables and radio frequency (\"RF\") or\\nmicrowave signals. The NEMs\\' customers are the distributors of end-user subscriber devices, including cell phones and personal digital assistants (\"PDAs\"), as well as communications service\\n4\\nTable of Contents\\nproviders that deploy and operate the networks and services. To meet their customers\\' demands, NEMs require test and measurement instruments, systems\\nand solutions for the development, production and installation of each network technology.\\nCommunications service providers require reliable network equipment that enables their networks and services to operate at ever-faster speeds, permits an expanding capacity and provides quick feedback. To achieve\\nthis, communications service providers require a range of sophisticated test instruments and systems to evaluate network performance and to identify any sources of communications failure.\\nAgilent\\'s communications service provider customers require advanced software and systems, known as operations support\\nsystems (\"OSSs\"), to monitor and manage the network infrastructure and services on a continuous, proactive basis to achieve either regulated or customer-specified service levels. Real-time monitoring of the network infrastructure also\\nenables the implementation of additional services, such as fraud detection and intercarrier billing, which enable service providers to capture the greatest revenue from network usage.\\nThe overall market for cellular mobility, specifically in handsets, grew in recent years as the levels of wireless\\npenetration in developed countries have increased. Wireless communications in emerging economies continues to increase. To advance cellular telephone equipment, manufacturers require electronic design automation software, test instruments and\\nsystems for the development of wireless devices, high-frequency communications circuits and systems. Cellular equipment manufacturers also require advanced, high-frequency test instruments and systems to develop, manufacture and deploy cellular base\\nstations for these wireless networks. In addition, the rapid expansion of the cellular handset market, coupled with subscriber turnover created by the introduction of new technologies, has fueled growth for automated test equipment to test cellular\\nhandsets on the factory floor. Investments continue for advanced R&D verification solutions for 2.5 generation (\"G\") and 3G appliance development and network deployment as the demand for complex wireless data networks increases.\\nFurther, as new standards evolve in the wireless industry, new\\ntest and measurement equipment and systems have to be developed to enable testing of the new standards in the research, design and development and later in the manufacturing and deployment phases. An example of this is wireless fidelity\\n(\"Wi-Fi\"), also called 802.11, for wireless local area networking. Companies are constantly finding applications for wireless technology, and are providing their customers wireless network access in areas called \"hot spots,\" such\\nas airports, coffee shops and libraries. As the adoption of these new standards becomes mainstream, additional markets are emerging, including larger companies and their network operators. The use of wireless test and measurement solutions is\\nquickly being adopted by these larger companies to ensure robust quality of service.\\nIn the last several years, producers of networking communications equipment have increased their use of contract manufacturers. Contract manufacturers require test solutions that are designed for faster production and\\nfor use in different applications. Mobile phone and other appliance producers are also increasing their use of contract manufacturers, original design manufacturers and reference design platforms, including using contract manufacturers for\\nfunctional test. This requires specialized test products and services to address the particular needs of these high-frequency products.\\nThe General Purpose Test Market\\nWe market our general purpose test products and services to the electronics industry. The electronics industry designs, develops and manufactures a wide\\nrange of products, including those\\n5\\nTable of Contents\\nproduced in high volumes, such as computers, computer peripherals, electronic components, consumer electronics, enterprise servers, storage networks and\\ncommunications devices including PDAs. The components, printed circuit assemblies and functional devices for these products may be designed, developed and manufactured by electronic components companies, by original equipment manufacturers or by\\ncontract manufacturers. For the development and timely commercialization of new technologies, manufacturers require state-of-the-art test instruments, systems and software design tools in order to design products for efficient and cost-effective\\nmanufacturing and to validate product performance in a variety of configurations and environments. Manufacturers of electronics products require sophisticated test equipment to operate and perform highly accurate tests from design through\\nmanufacturing. They also demand automated functional test systems, which test an electronic device as if it were in use in its final environment. Finally, electronics manufacturers require standardized test instruments, system components and\\ncomplete solutions.\\nWe also market our general purpose test\\nproducts to the aerospace and defense industry. Aerospace and defense is an important market for standardized electronic equipment because of the high electronic content of advanced defense systems and defense-related communications and surveillance\\nequipment. We believe that defense purchasers will continue to shift from specialized test equipment to commercial off-the-shelf test products and systems and will continue to require solutions that optimize asset utilization and effective\\ntechnology lifecycle management.\\nTest and Measurement\\nProducts\\nOur test and measurement business designs,\\ndevelops and manufactures test and measurement products and services that range from single-unit electronic measurement devices priced under $1,000 to large scale test systems or OSS solutions priced at $1 million and higher. We divide our test and\\nmeasurement products into two groups: (1) communications test products and (2) general purpose test products.\\nCommunications Test Products\\nWe sell installation and maintenance solutions and OSS, including monitoring and network management systems, for the following types of communications\\nnetworks and systems: fiber optics networks, transport networks, broadband and data networks, wireless communications and microwave networks.\\nFiber Optic Network Products.\\nOur fiber optic network test products include optical signal instruments, spectrum analysis\\ninstruments and lightwave optical systems, such as optical amplifier test, passive component test and jitter test instruments. These items are used by the industry\\'s leading NEMs to develop and manufacture reliable optical components and\\nmodules.

Our N2X\\nmulti-service tester combines services testing with carrier-grade infrastructure testing and emulation, and integrates the performance of Router Tester 900, OmniBER XM and SAN Tester.\\nBroadband and Data Network Products.\\nOur broadband and data network test products include our\\nNetwork Analyzer and Router Tester 900. Our Network Analyzer product line helps to troubleshoot high-speed local area networks (\"LANs\"), wide area networks (\"WANs\") and asynchronous transfer mode networks. Our Router Tester 900\\nis the industry leader in core edge router performance verification.\\n6\\nTable of Contents\\nWireless Communications and Microwave Network Products.\\nWe design and sell\\nRF and microwave test instruments and Electronic Design Automation (\"EDA\") software tools, which assist in the design and production of cellular handsets and base stations, as well as satellite and aerospace defense systems. Examples of\\nour wireless communications products include specialized versions of RF and microwave network analyzers, spectrum analyzers, signal sources, mobile testers, circuit simulation tools and system simulation tools. Agilent also offers solutions for\\ncentralized wireless LAN monitoring and network optimization. Our AiRMS solution provides remote monitoring of network performance using a series of remote probes deployed in service vehicles and taxicabs. The Agilent N5250A PNA series\\nmillimeter-wave network analyzer has frequency coverage from 10 MHz to 110 GHz in a single sweep. This capability enables engineers and system integrators working at millimeter-wave frequencies to take advantage of additional performance and\\nconnectivity, and gives them the ability to characterize 1.0 mm coaxial and on-wafer components, subsystems and systems.\\nInstallation and Maintenance Solutions.\\nOur solutions for installation test enable service providers to install, commission,\\nand activate networks and services more quickly. Agilent has a breadth of solutions for troubleshooting and maintaining optical, wireless, wireline and large-company networks. These solutions include Fiber Break Locator, Network Tester, Optical Time\\nDomain Reflectometers (\"OTDR\"), Network Troubleshooting Center, and Framescope. We also market bench-top and handheld measurement devices such as lightwave multimeters, power meters and optical sources.\\nOperations Support Systems and\\nServices.\\nAgilent\\'s OSS focus is to help communications service providers manage their business from a customer-centric perspective so they can understand how problems in network or service performance affect\\nindividual subscribers or groups of subscribers. Our integrated OSS solutions reduce software integration costs and enable high-value service-level management functions not possible with stand-alone systems. We offer a number of industry-proven\\nmonitoring and management systems, such as acceSS7 for Signaling System 7 networks; NETeXPERT for circuit, packet and hybrid networks; NgN Analysis System for next-generation telephony and Internet offload networks; Wireless Service Manager for\\nwireless services and networks; and Wireless QoS Manager for mobile data services and networks.\\nGeneral Purpose Test Products\\nWe sell the following types of products into the general purpose test market: general purpose instruments, modular instruments and test software, digital\\ndesign products and high frequency electronic design tools.\\nGeneral Purpose Instruments.\\nGeneral purpose test instruments are used principally by engineers in R&D laboratories, manufacturing, calibration and service for measuring voltage, current, frequency, signal\\npulse width and other standard electronics measurements. Examples of our general purpose test instruments include spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, signal generators, digitizing oscilloscopes, voltmeters, multimeters, frequency counters, bench\\nand system power supplies, function generators and waveform synthesizers.\\nModular Instruments and Test Software.\\nOur modular instruments and test software, including instruments incorporating the new LXI standard (LAN eXtensions for Instrumentation) and modular\\nmeasurement system software, are used to dynamically configure and reconfigure test systems for designers and manufacturers of electronic devices. This allows easy and fast connectivity between instruments and PCs. In addition, release 14 of\\nAgilent\\'s IO Library Suite reduces PC configuration and connect time to less than 15 minutes. Together with major revisions of Agilent VEE (7.0) and the Test & Measurement Programmers Toolkit for Visual Studio® (2.0), these products speed test development and reduce the cost of test for\\nour customers.\\n7\\nTable of Contents\\nDigital Design Products.\\nOur digital design products range from simple\\ndigital control circuits to complex, high-speed servers incorporating the latest microprocessor technology, and include high performance oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, logic-signal sources and data generators. Agilent\\'s 10 to 13 GHz real-time\\noscilloscopes are the only models in the industry that offer full-bandwidth, 40 GSa/s per channel. When these new scopes are paired with the Agilent InfiniiMax probes of up to 12 GHz, the new system delivers industry-leading performance, accuracy\\nand probing connectivity. This is used by R&D engineers in the computer, communications and semiconductor industries for validating and verifying the performance of new high-speed digital product designs.\\nHigh-Frequency Electronic Design Tools.\\nOur\\nhigh-frequency electronic design automation software tools are used by RF integrated circuit design engineers to model, simulate and analyze communications product designs at the circuit and system levels. The main products in this area are the\\nAdvanced Design System (ADS), the RF Design Environment (RFDE) and the IC-CAP Device Modeling Software. Each are well-established software platforms within the wireless and the aerospace and defense design communities. Our customers are also\\napplying this technology more frequently to model signal integrity problems in digital design applications.\\nTest and Measurement Customers\\nAgilent\\'s test and measurement customers include the NEMs who design, develop, manufacture and install network equipment, and the service providers\\nwho implement, maintain and manage communication networks and services. Many of our customers purchase solutions across several of our major product lines for their different business units. As of the end of fiscal 2004, no single customer\\nrepresented greater than 10% of the net revenue of the business.\\nThe orders and revenues of the test and measurement business are somewhat seasonal, with our fourth quarter traditionally bringing larger volumes of business and our first quarter generally showing reduced volumes. This is especially true\\nof products that we sell to the aerospace and defense industry as well as those that are linked to consumer spending, including some of our communications test equipment. However, the seasonal impact is tempered by the diversity of the test and\\nmeasurement business\\'s products and customers, which span multiple industries.\\nTest and Measurement Sales, Marketing and Support\\nWe have a focused sales strategy, using a direct sales force, resellers, manufacturer\\'s representatives and distributors to strengthen customer\\nsatisfaction. Our direct sales force is focused on identifying customer needs and recommending solutions involving the effective use and deployment of our equipment, services, systems and capabilities. Some members of our direct sales force focus on\\nglobal accounts, providing uniform services on a worldwide basis. Others focus on our more complex products such as our communications OSS monitoring systems, where customers require intensive strategic consultation. Our sales force also\\nspecifically targets the contract manufacturer market by collaborating with original equipment manufacturers to specify that contract manufacturers use our test equipment, as well as marketing to contract manufacturers directly.\\nOur direct sales force consists of field engineers and systems engineers who\\nhave in-depth knowledge of the customers\\' business and technology needs. Some of our field engineers are account managers for our large accounts, and enhance our understanding of the future needs of these customers. Our systems engineers\\nprovide a combination of consulting, systems integration and application and software engineering services, and are instrumental in all stages of the sale, implementation and support of our complex systems and solutions.\\n8\\nTable of Contents\\nTo complement our direct sales force we have agreements with many channel partners around the world.\\nThese partners, including resellers, manufacturer\\'s representatives, and distributors, serve Agilent\\'s customers across a number of product lines and provide the same level of service and support expected from our direct channel. Our\\nproducts come with clearly outlined warranties and extended warranties available for an additional cost.\\nTest and Measurement Manufacturing\\nWe concentrate our test and measurement manufacturing efforts primarily on final assembly and test of our products. To maximize our productivity and our\\nability to respond to market conditions, we use contract manufacturers for the production of printed circuit boards, sheetmetal fabrication, metal die-casting, plastic molding and standard electronic components. We also manufacture proprietary\\ndevices and assemblies, in our own fabrication facilities for competitive advantage.\\nWe generally only manufacture products when we have received firm orders for delivery, and do not generally hold large stocks of finished inventory. However, due to the large number of components and products we\\nmanufacture, we hold relatively large amounts of raw materials.\\nTest and Measurement Competition\\nThe\\nmarket for test and measurement equipment is highly competitive, and we expect this competition to increase. Our test and measurement business competes with a number of significant competitors in all our major product categories and across our\\ntargeted industries. In the general purpose electronic test market, we compete against companies such as Fluke Corporation (a subsidiary of Danaher Corporation), Keithley Instruments, Inc., LeCroy Corporation, National Instruments Corporation\\nand Tektronix, Inc. In the communications test market, our primary competitors are Acterna Corporation, Aeroflex Incorporated, Anritsu Corporation, EXFO Electro-Optical Engineering, Inc., Ixia, Marconi Corporation, McAfee, Inc. (formerly Network\\nAssociates, Inc.), Rohde & Schwartz GmbH & Co. KG, Spirent, Tektronix, Inc., as well as Telcordia, Hewlett Packard Company and Micromuse, Inc. in the communications network monitoring market. Our EDA business also has several software\\ncompetitors, including Ansoft Corporation, APLAC Solutions Corporation, Applied Wave Research, Inc., Eagleware Manufacturing Company, Inc., and Xpedion Design Systems, Inc.\\nIn fiscal year 2004 and following the general economic recovery, pricing pressure eased in some of our markets.\\nAutomated Test Business\\nOur automated test business provides test solutions that are used in the\\nmanufacture of semiconductor devices, electronics (primarily printed circuit-board assemblies) and flat panel displays (\"FPDs\"). These solutions are complemented by consulting, service and support offerings such as start-up assistance,\\napplication services and system calibration and repair. Our automated test business\\'s test solutions enable electronics designers and manufacturers to shorten the design-to-production cycle, lower manufacturing cost of test, confirm the\\nfunctional quality of their devices and of their manufacturing processes and accelerate the high-volume delivery of their products.\\nOur automated test business employed approximately 2,200 people as of October 31, 2004. We sell our automated test business\\'s solutions through\\ndirect sales and through manufacturers\\' representatives. Our automated test business generated $0.9 billion in revenue in fiscal 2004, $0.8 billion in revenue in fiscal 2003 and $0.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2002.\\n9\\nTable of Contents\\nAutomated Test Markets\\nAgilent\\'s automated test business sells to the semiconductor manufacturing markets, the electronics manufacturing\\nmarkets and the FPD markets. Customers in these markets use our automated test equipment for wafer-level parametric testing, wafer-sort and final sort for memory test, package-level functional test, structural and electrical testing and inspection\\nfor printed circuit board assemblies and thin-film transistor (\"TFT\") array test for FPDs.\\nMarket demand for automated test equipment is driven both by changes in the increased volume of semiconductor devices produced and by developments in\\nsemiconductor performance and function, packaging and assembly technology.\\nThe development of increasingly faster and more complex semiconductor devices stimulates demand for testers capable of evaluating these high-speed devices. In addition, the continuing integration of functions, such as\\nmicroprocessor, logic, analog, RF and logic, application specific integrated circuits (\"ASICs\") and memory on a single integrated circuit has created a category of device called system-on-a-chip (\"SOC\"). These devices require\\nupdates to our sophisticated and flexible automated test equipment.\\nIn the electronics manufacturing market, new technologies and processes, increasing density and miniaturization of parts, stimulate demand. New materials and smaller parts such as ceramic column grid arrays, ceramic ball grid arrays and\\nultra-miniature resistors or capacitors (\"0201s\"), make new demands on test equipment. The same is true for new and evolving manufacturing processes, such as the pending introduction of lead-free solder. This increases demand for test\\nequipment that provides increased resolution for the highest call accuracy and a range of solutions to access issues.\\nThe use of FPDs is becoming increasingly common in a wide variety of consumer devices that include cellular phones, digital cameras, liquid crystal\\ndisplay (\"LCD\") televisions, computer displays, digital cameras and PDAs. Different technologies are evolving to improve brightness and resolution on the screens. A TFT array tester, such as the two testers introduced by our automated test\\nbusiness in October 2004, helps improve display quality while lowering costs. These TFT array testers detect defects accurately and early in the manufacturing process, regardless of the FPD technology being used.\\nAutomated Test Products\\nOur automated test business designs, develops and manufactures semiconductor\\ntest equipment, electronics manufacturing test equipment and TFT array test equipment. We typically develop our automated test products on a single system architecture and then deliver, over time, enhancements to that architecture that extend its\\ntest capabilities. For instance, in 2004 Agilent expanded the capabilities of our 93000 SOC system by further expanding its high-speed performance to address emerging high-speed interconnect technology. At the same time, Agilent introduced a\\nlow-cost parallel probe (wafer sort) solution on the same platform. Our customers can adapt their 93000 SOC system according to their needs without having to buy multiple unique testers. We also introduced the V5400 memory tester, based on current\\nAgilent Versatest architecture, that addresses the growing phenomenon of stacked, mixed memory chips, including any combination of flash, dynamic random access memory (\"DRAM\") and static random access memory (\"SRAM\").\\nSemiconductor Test Equipment\\nWe produce semiconductor test equipment to perform electrical functional\\ntesting of the operation of logic, memory, mixed analog and digital signal, RF, microwave and SOC integrated\\n10\\nTable of Contents\\ncircuits. Our parametric test instruments and systems combine hardware technology and customizable system software, and are used to examine semiconductor\\nwafers during the semiconductor manufacturing process. Our product development efforts are targeted at leading edge technologies, such as high-speed interconnects, highly integrated mixed-signal memory, parametric test for 90nm and below geometries,\\nand emerging-technology FPDs.\\nOur semiconductor test equipment\\ntests a variety of different circuit types. We test both at the wafer level and at final assembly. We are an industry leader in wafer-sort test solutions for flash memory devices, which retain data even when the power is turned off and that are used\\nin digital cameras, cellular phones, PDAs and storage of portable digital audio files. Our flash memory test products can test as many as 4,608 channels to test multiple devices in parallel, greatly improving test throughput and lowering test costs\\nfor our customers. Our SOC test system can test not only multiple devices at a time, but also multiple functional elements on a given device at the same time. As a result of its scalable platform architecture, this system can be field-upgraded to\\nthe latest technology without the customer needing to buy a new system or shut down the production line for an extended time.\\nElectronics Manufacturing Test Equipment\\nAutomated Optical Inspection Products.\\nOur automated optical inspection line of products enables automated visual inspection\\nof printed circuit assemblies. These systems locate, with a high degree of repeatability and reliability, misplaced and misaligned parts, gross solder defects and other process faults without the need for a human inspector.\\nAutomated X-ray Inspection Products.\\nOur\\nleading x-ray inspection products provide a three-dimensional scan of printed circuit board assemblies to identify and isolate quality defects caused by the manufacturing process. Our products can look through a device to identify structural defects\\nin soldering that are not identified by visual inspection and that may not be detected with in-circuit testing.\\nAutomated In-Circuit Testing Products.\\nOur leading in-circuit testers use a probe fixture that makes electrical contact with\\nthe circuit board.

Agilent Labs engages primarily in two types of research: 1) applied research that leads to technology that\\ncan be transferred to our existing businesses in communications, life sciences, and electronics, and 2) research that creates new businesses that are outside of our current markets but within our fields of interest. Agilent Labs also provides\\ntechnology integration across our company.\\nAgilent Labs\\nemploys approximately 300 people. About 70 percent of Agilent Labs\\' employees are members of the technical staff, and about 70 percent of the technical staff have advanced degrees that cover a wide range of scientific fields, including biology,\\nbioinformatics, chemistry, computer science, electrical engineering, image processing, materials science, mathematics, optoelectronics, photonics, physics, physiology, semiconductor technology and systems integration.\\nThe following discussions of Research and Development, Backlog,\\nIntellectual Property, Materials, Environmental, International Operations and Acquisition and Disposal of Material Assets include information common to all four of our segments.\\nResearch and Development\\nResearch and development expenditures were $933 million in 2004, $1,051 million in 2003 and $1,250 million in 2002, the vast majority of which was\\ncompany-sponsored. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services.\\nBacklog\\nWe believe that backlog orders are not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects. Backlog, as we define it,\\ngenerally only represents cumulative outstanding orders that are scheduled for delivery within a six-month period. Therefore backlog is not a material indicator of our future medium- to long-term business prospects. We believe that our incoming\\norders in any given period are more indicative of short-term revenue trends for our businesses. However, for our Semiconductor Products business, neither backlog nor orders are indicative of future business prospects since the time between receipt\\nof an order and revenue recognition has decreased significantly during 2004. See \"Results of Continuing Operations\" in Item 7 of this report.\\nIntellectual Property\\nOur general policy has been to seek patent and other intellectual property protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into\\nour products and services or to give us a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and applications have value, in general no single patent or license is in itself essential. In addition, there can be no assurance that any\\nof our proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that our rights will provide significant competitive advantages.\\n22\\nTable of Contents\\nMaterials\\nOur manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors, electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials such as plastic resins\\nand sheet metal. Each of our segments purchases materials from thousands of suppliers on a global basis. No single supplier is material, although some of the parts that require custom design work are not readily available from alternate suppliers\\ndue to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work. Our long-term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage technology road maps and product discontinuance plans and monitor their financial health. Even\\nso, some suppliers may still extend their lead times, limit supplies, increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products. If these are unique components, we may not be able to find a substitute quickly, or at all. To address the\\npotential disruption in our supply chain, we use a number of techniques, including qualifying multiple sources of supply, redesign of products for alternative components and purchase of incremental inventory for supply buffer.\\nEnvironmental\\nOur R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under\\ninternational, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and worker health and safety to sites inside and outside the U.S., even if not subject to\\nregulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws; however, the risk of environmental\\nliabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to Agilent will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of\\ninternational, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. These laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures.\\nSome of our operations are located on properties that are known to have\\nsubsurface contamination undergoing remediation by Hewlett-Packard. Hewlett-Packard has agreed to retain the liability for the contamination, perform the required remediation and indemnify us with respect to claims arising out of the contamination.\\nThe determination of the existence and cost of any additional contamination caused by us could involve costly and time-consuming negotiations and litigation. While we expect that Hewlett-Packard will meet its remediation and indemnification\\nobligations in this regard, there can be no guarantee that it will do so. Under our agreement with Hewlett-Packard, Hewlett-Packard will have access to these properties to perform the remediation. Hewlett-Packard has agreed to minimize interference\\nwith on-site operations at those properties during the course of the remediation, but there can be no guarantee that our operations will not be interrupted or that we will not be required to incur unreimbursed costs associated with the remediation.\\nRemediation could also harm on-site operations and the future use and value of the properties.\\nIn addition, some of these properties are undergoing remediation by Hewlett-Packard under an order of an agency of the state in which the property is located. Although Hewlett-Packard has agreed to indemnify us with\\nrespect to that subsurface contamination, it is possible that one or more of the governmental agencies will require us to be named on any of these orders. The naming of Agilent will not affect Hewlett-Packard\\'s obligation to indemnify us with\\nregard to these matters.\\nWe are liable and are indemnifying\\nHewlett-Packard for any contamination found at all facilities transferred to us by Hewlett-Packard excluding the properties undergoing remediation. In addition, we are indemnifying Hewlett-Packard for any liability associated with past\\nnon-compliance with environmental laws regulating ongoing operations at all properties transferred to us by Hewlett-\\n23\\nTable of Contents\\nPackard, as well as at sold or discontinued businesses that are related to our businesses. While we are not aware of any material liabilities associated with\\nsuch indemnified matters, there is no guarantee that such contamination or regulatory non-compliance does not exist, and will not expose us to material liability in the future.\\nWe are being indemnified by Hewlett-Packard with respect to all environmental liabilities for which Hewlett-Packard accrued\\na reserve and we are not aware of any material and probable environmental liabilities being assumed by us which are not subject to the indemnity.\\nInternational Operations\\nOur net revenue originating outside the U.S., as a percentage of our total net revenue, was approximately 69 percent in fiscal 2004, 64 percent in fiscal\\n2003 and 61 percent in fiscal 2002, the majority of which was from customers other than foreign governments. Approximately 11 percent of our revenue in the last three years was derived from Japan. Revenues from external customers are generally\\nattributed to countries based upon the location of the Agilent sales representative. Long-lived assets located outside of the U.S., as a percentage of our total long-lived assets, was approximately 53 percent in fiscal year 2004, 47 percent in\\nfiscal year 2003 and 43 percent in fiscal year 2002. Approximately 12 percent of our long-lived assets were located in Japan in fiscal year 2004, approximately 14 percent were located in Japan in fiscal year 2003 and approximately 10 percent in\\nfiscal year 2002.\\nMost of our sales in international markets\\nare made by foreign sales subsidiaries. In countries with low sales volumes, sales are made through various representatives and distributors. However, we also sell into international markets directly from the U.S.\\nOur international business is subject to risks customarily encountered in\\nforeign operations, including interruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers, changes in a specific country\\'s or region\\'s political or economic conditions, trade protection measures,\\nimport or export licensing requirements, unexpected changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, differing labor regulations and differing protection of intellectual property. We are\\nalso exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local functional currency, and may also become subject to interest rate\\nrisk inherent in any debt we incur, or investment and finance receivable portfolios we hold. The U.S. and international response to recent terrorist activities could exacerbate these risks. For example, there may be an increased risk of political\\nunrest in regions where we have significant manufacturing operations such as Southeast Asia. However, we believe that our international diversification provides stability to our worldwide operations and reduces the impact on us of adverse economic\\nchanges in any single country. Financial information about our international operations is contained in Note 19, \"Segment Information,\" of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 15 of this report.\\nAcquisition and Disposal of Material Assets\\nOn January 5, 2001, we acquired Objective Systems Integrators, Inc.\\n(\"OSI\") for approximately $716 million. OSI was a provider of next-generation operations-support-system software for communications service providers and has become part of our test and measurement business. In January 2000, April 2000 and\\nJanuary 2001, we acquired Yokogawa Electric Corporation\\'s 25 percent equity interest in Agilent Technologies Japan, Ltd. for approximately $521 million. In addition to the OSI and Yokogawa acquisitions, we acquired several other companies since\\nour incorporation that were not material.\\n24\\nTable of Contents\\nIn the fourth quarter of 2000, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with CIT Group Inc.\\n(\"CIT,\" formerly Tyco Capital Corporation) to sell them substantially all of our leasing portfolio over the course of 2000 and 2001. We also entered into a vendor financing arrangement with CIT whereby CIT will provide equipment financing\\nand leasing services to our customers on a global basis.\\nIn\\nFebruary 2001, we sold a parcel of surplus land in San Jose, California for $287 million in cash.\\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\\nThe names of our executive officers and their ages, titles and biographies as of December 16, 2004, appear below.\\nEdward W.
